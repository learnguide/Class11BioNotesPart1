["THE LIVING WORLD Life can be defined as a unique aggregation of molecules. These molecules have the tendency to express themselves through various chemical reactions collectively called metabolic reactions. The basic purpose of these reactions is to transform or produce and utilize energy. The term used to define these reactions in a cumulative way is metabolism. Through metabolism, various biomolecules are synthesized resulting in growth, development, responsiveness, adaptations and reproduction. The forms that possess and express all these features are called living beings. These living beings live in almost all possible habitats like forests, mountains, deserts, oceans, freshwater bodies, hot springs, polar regions etc.They are linked to one another by sharing the common genetic material. All living beings share characteristics like organization, energy utilization, regulation or homeostasis, growth, development, reproduction and adaptation. 1.1 WHAT IS GROWING Life has maintained certain fixed properties that life exhibits today and are very different from those that were present at its origin. Characteristics of living organisms: The most outstanding features that have arisen during life’s history include • Growth • Reproduction • Ability to sense environment • Metabolism • Cellular organization • Consciousness. 1. GROWTH : It is the increase in number & mass of cells by cell division. All living organisms have the capacity to grow. Growth of an individual organism has two characteristics- 1. Increase in body mass 2. Increase in number. In plants, growth occurs continuously throughout their lifespan. In animals, growth is only up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs to replace lost cells. Unicellular organisms also grow by cell division. Non-living objects grow by accumulation of material (increase in mass) on the surface. For example: mountains, boulders, sand mounds etc. So growth cannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms alone. A dead organism does not grow. 2. REPRODUCTION : In living organisms reproduction means the formation of new individuals from their parents. 1 ","Fungi multiply and spread easily by producing millions of asexual spores. Hydra and yeast multiply by budding. Planaria, a flat worm regenerates the lost part of its body and become a new one. Filamentous algae, protonema of mosses and fungi also multiply by fragmentation. In unicellular organisms reproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells. Therefore in unicellular organisms, there is no distinction in the usage of the terms growth and reproduction. Many organisms do not reproduce - e.g. mules, worker bees, infertile human couples, etc. Hence, reproduction is not a perfect defining characteristic of living organisms. 3. METABOLISM: A variety of biochemical changes are constantly occurring in a living organism leading to formation and interconversion of chemicals. All the chemical reactions taking place in our body come under metabolism. Non-living things do not metabolise. All living organisms show metabolism. However, metabolic reactions can be mimicked under in vitro conditions. 4. CELLULAR ORGANIZATION: All living organisms are made up of cells. The cells perform all functions in the organism. Non-living things do not have a cellular organization. Therefore, it can be seen that a cellular organization gives rise to the functions of life-like metabolism, growth, reproduction, etc. Thus cellular organization is a defining characteristic of living organisms. 5. CONSCIOUSNESS: -It is the awareness of one’s environment, actions and intentions. It is present in living organisms. Human beings sense the environment through sense organs. Plants respond to external factors like light, temperature, water, pollutants, other organisms etc. In both plants and animals, photoperiod (duration of light) affects the reproduction in seasonal breeders. Therefore, all organisms are ‘aware’ of their surroundings. So, it is the defining property of living organisms. Human is the only organism having self-consciousness i.e. aware of himself. Therefore consciousness is the defining property of living organisms. All living organisms are linked to one another by the sharing of common genetic material to varying degree. 1.2 DIVERSITY IN THE IVING WORLD : Earth provides the physical base for living beings. There are millions of varieties of living organisms in the world around us. There are also many organisms that we cannot see with our naked eye around us. They are found in varied habitats like mountains, oceans, forests, lakes, deserts and even hot water springs. Number of species identified and studied is 1.7-1.8 million. All organisms which live on earth together make up the natural diversity of life in the world. This natural diversity of life on earth is generally called biological diversity or biodiversity. Taxonomy: The systematic arrangement of organisms that includes characterization, identification, nomenclature, and classification of organisms is called taxonomy. Systematics is a branch of science that deals with identification, nomenclature, classification and evolutionary history of an organism. Thus systematics includes evolutionary history along with taxonomic characteristics of an organism. Systematics is as old as human civilization. The term taxonomy was first introduced by A.P de Candolle in 1813. 2 ","Systematic s (Latin ‘systema’) means systematic arrangement of organisms. Systema Naturae is the book written by Linnaeus. Neosystematics is a concept of systematics that considers a species to be the product of evolution. This concept was developed by Julia Huxley in 1940.It takes into consideration all the known characteristics of organisms and all the known evidences from different fields of biology. Identification: is to determine the exact place or position of an organism in the set plan of classification. It is carried out with the help of taxonomic keys. Classification: It is the placing of an organism or a group of organisms in category according to a particular system and in conformity with a nomenclature system. Characterization: The understanding of characters of organisms like external and internal structure (morphology and anatomy), the structure of the cell (cytology), developmental process (embryology) and ecological information (ecology) of organism. Nomenclature ( naming): The naming of living organisms is called nomenclature. The names are of two types-vernacular (common names) and scientific names. Local names-Locally used names are called as local names . Local names are in local languages or common language. Local names are easy to use by local people, but these local names cannot be used by biologists due to the following draw backs. • 1. A single local name is often used for many species. • 2. The local names sometimes lead incorrect meaning about the organism. • 3. Different local names are used to recognize an organism in different regions of country or world. These local names also vary with the language. Scientific names: These are the names given to the organisms by biologists based on agreed principle and criteria. These are acceptable all over the world. To accomplish this, certain international codes have been established. These codes are • ICBN-International Code of Botanical Nomenclature • ICZN-International Code of Zoological Nomenclature • ICVN-International Code of Viral Nomenclature ICBN/ICNB-International Code for Bacteriological Nomenclature or Nomenclature of Bacteria BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE: Carolus Linnaeus used this nomenclature system for the first time and proposed scientific name of all the plants and animals. He is the founder of binomial system. Li nnaeus proposed scientific name of plants in his book” Species plantarum” In binomial nomenclature, each scientific name has two components-generic name (genus) and specific name (species) E.g., Mangifera indica Linn. Mangifera is the genus name and indica is the species name. Linn indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus Who can give scientific names : Any one can study, describe, identify and give name to an organism provided certain universal rules are followed. Rules: 1. A scientific name generally has two components (words) in Latin or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin. 2. First word of the biological name denotes the genus name where as the second one denotes for species. 3. Names are printed in italics or when hand written they are separately underlined to indicate their Latin origin. 3 ","4. Genus name starts with capital letter and specific name starts with small letter. 5. The name of the author is written in an abbreviated form after the species name and it is printed in Roman. 6. Each taxonomic group can have only one correct name. 7. The name should be short, precise and easy to pronounce. Eg: Mangifera indica - Mangifera is the genus name and indica is the species name. 1.3 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES: The term taxon was introduced for the first time by ICBN in 1956. Mayr in 1964 defined Taxon as a taxonomic group of any rank that is sufficiently distinct to be worthy of being assigned a definite category. TAXONOMIC HIERARCHY: The system of arranging organisms in a definite sequence of various taxonomic categories arranged in a proper descending order is called taxonomic hierarchy. It is also called Linnaean hierarchy as it was first proposed by Carolus Linnaeus, the Father of Systematic Botany . The hierarchy includes seven obligate categories. They are as follows- Kingdom - Animalia ↑ Phylum - Chordata (Division in case of plants) ↑ Class - Mammalia ↑ Order - Primata ↑ Family - Hominidae ↑ Genus - Homo ↑ Species – sapiens 1.3.1 Species: The lowest taxon or category in the biological classification is the species. So the basic unit of taxonomy is species. So the basic unit of taxonomy is species. Species is a group of individuals resembling one another in all major vegetative and reproductive characteristics . The individuals of a species resemble so closely 4 ","that they may be regarded as having been derived from the same parents. In 1964, Ernst Mayr defined species as a group of potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. The term species was first introduced by John Ray. Eg: sapiens 1.3.2Genus: A group of related species . All the species in a genus have many common characteristics and all have evolved from a common ancestor. E.g.: Homo 1.3.3 Family: A family is an assemblage of related genera. E.g.: Hominidae 1.3.4 Order or Cohort: An order is a group of related Families. E.g.: Primata 1.3.5 Class: Several related orders having certain common characters form a higher category called the class. E.g.: Mammalia 1.3.6 Phylum/Division: Classes having same features in common constitute a Phylum. The term phylum is used in the case of classification of animals and the term division is used in plant classification . E.g.: Chordata 1.3.7 Kingdom: The highest taxon or category in biological classification is the Kingdom. It includes one or more related divisions or phyla . Plants are put in Kingdom Plantae and animals are put in the Kingdom Animalia. E.g.: Plantae, Animalia. Generic name Specific epithet Common name Mangifera indica Mango 5 ","Solanum tuberosum Potato Solanum nigrum Nightshade Panthera leo Lion Panthera tigris Tiger Homo sapiens Man 1.4 Taxonomical Aids: They are useful in agriculture, forestry and industry. These studies are essential for knowing our bioresources and biodiversity. Taxonomic work involves studies both in field and in laboratory. Taxonomists have developed different types of taxonomic aids to help in identification, nomenclature and classification of organisms. The important taxonomic aids are herbaria, botanical gardens, museums, zoological parks and keys. 1.4.1 (A). Herbarium : It is a depository of plant specimens in dry condition. The specimens are dried, mounted on a paper and properly labeled. Procedure: 1. Collection of specimens 2. Pressing and drying: to remove moisture content 3. Sterilization or poisoning: to prevent fungal attack 4. Mounting: Pasting or stitching on a sheet 5. Labeling of specimens: Local name, Common English name, Binomial nomenclature, Family name, Place of collection, Date and time of collection, Collectors name. 6. Storage of herbarium sheets. Each herbarium sheet is to be labeled properly to avoid confusion. The label should carry scientific name along with author’s name, local name, name of family, locality, date of collection, name of collector etc. The label is pasted on the right hand corner at the bottom of the herbarium sheet. 6 ","Information about the collected specimens is published in the form of a book called flora. It gives a list of total plant species in a particular region together with a brief description of the same. Some important floras of India are Flora of British India, Flora of Delhi, Flora of Madras, Flora of Travancore etc. The largest Herbarium of the world is Herbarium of Royal Botanical Garden at Kew in England . The largest Herbarium in India is Central National Herbarium in the Indian Botanical Garden at Kolkata established in 1787. 1.4.2 (B).Botanical gardens: Botanical gardens are places or institutions that maintain the living plant specimens of different varieties of plants for reference. A botanical garden contains plant species from various corners of the world. Plant species in botanical garden are grown for identification purpose. Each plant is labelled.The label should carry its botanical name and its family. Botanical garden has green houses, a library, a herbarium, research laboratory etc. It is, therefore, not merely a garden but a botanical institution. At present there are over 600 botanical gardens in the world . The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are considered among the wonders of the ancient world. The largest Botanical Garden of the world is Royal botanical garden at Kew in England. It is called the botanical capital of the world . Bentham and Hooker were associated with this garden. The largest botanical garden of India is Indian Botanical garden at Kolkata . The largest tropical botanical garden in Asia is Tropical Botanical Garden at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. 7 ","KEW GARDEN 1.4.3 Museum: It is the institution where artistic and educational plants or animals are preserved, stored and exhibited to public. There are natural science museum, Science museum and Zoological museum. All colleges maintain museums in Botany and Zoology Departments. Animals are also preserved in museums. The specimens are fixed in the jars or containers in chemical solutions and are preserved for longer duration. The specimens are correctly identified and labeled. They are stored and a catalogue is prepared for future reference. Plants and animal specimens are also preserved as dry specimens. Insects are preserved in insect boxes after collecting, killing and pinning. Birds and mammals are stuffed and preserved. Animal skeletons are also kept in museums. 1.4.5 (D).Keys: A key is a tool by which each species in a group of organisms may be identified . It is prepared by a taxonomist to help other biologists to identify the species. Taxonomic keys are based on contrasting characters. The characters are in a pair called couplet. Key may be of two types-indented key and bracketed key. 8 ","If a key provides sequence of choices between two or more statements of characters of species, it is called indented key . Each statement in a key is called a lead. If the pairs of contrasting characters are not repeated by subdividing characters and each character is given a number in bracket, it is called bracketed key. (e).Zoological parks: Zoological parks are the places where animals are kept in protected environment under human care. These enable us to learn about their food habits and behavior . The largest zoo in the world is the zoological park of Kruger in South Africa. The largest zoo in India is the Zoo of Kolkata. OTHER TAXONOMIC AIDS : Besides the above mentioned taxonomic aids , flora, manuals, monographs and catalogues also serve as taxonomic aids for correct identification. Flora: These contain the actual account of habitat and distribution of plant species of a given area. It provides the index to plants occurring in a particular area. Hooker compiled first complete flora of India. 9 ","Monograph: These are hand books which provide the available information of any one taxon (family or genus). Manuals: These provide information for identification of names of species occurring in an area. They also help in correct identification. Catalogue: These provide the list of publications . The publications publish the books, periodicals, and dictionaries which provide new information for taxonomic studies. FAST TRACK REVISION: 1. The organisms exhibiting metabolism, cellular organization, homeostasis, growth, reproduction, development, responsiveness and other characteristics of life are designed as living things. 2. Growth is an irreversible increase in the mass of an individual. 3. Systematics deals with identification, nomenclature, classification and evolutionary history of an organism. 4. Identification is to determine the exact place or position of an organism in the set plan of classification. 5. Classification is an arrangement of organisms into groups on the basis of similarities. 10 ","6. Nomenclature deals with the determination of a scientific name of organisms using international code of nomenclature. 7. Binomial nomenclature -The system of naming with two components or epithets – generic and specific epithet and is proposed by Carolus Linnaeus. 8. The sequence of arrangement of these taxonomic categories in their order is known as taxonomical hierarchy and each level in the hierarchy is known as taxon. 9. Taxonomic hierarchy is the sequence of taxonomic categories in a descending order of number of species. Kingdom → Phylum/Division → Class → Order → Family → Genus→ Species 10. Taxonomical aids-Techniques and procedures to store information and specimens for identification and classification of organisms. 11. Herbarium is a storehouse of dried, pressed, and preserved plant specimens. 12. Museum has collection of preserved plant and animal specimens. 13. Botanical garden has collection of living plants. 14. Zoological parks are the places, where wild animals are kept in protected environment under human care. 15. Key is used for identification of plants and animals, based on similarities and differences. 16. Flora is a book or other work dealing the plants of a particular region or habit. 17. Monograph gives comprehensive information of a single taxon in biological studies. 18. Manual provides information for identification of name of species found in a particular area. 11 ","Biological classification Biological classification Biological classification is defined as the process of grouping the organisms according to certain similarities Linnaeus proposed the two kingdoms of classification . He classified organism into animal kingdom as Animalia and plant kingdom as Plantae . There were certain limitations associated with two kingdom classification such as- it does not differentiate between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms, and photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms. Five kingdom classifications R.H. Whittaker proposed the five kingdoms of classification. The five kingdoms classification is as follows- Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia . The classification was based on thallus organization, cell structure, mode of nutrition, phylogenetic relationship, and reproduction. Fig.1. Five kingdom classifications Kingdom Monera The most important members of Monera are Bacteria. All organisms present in this kingdom are prokaryotes. It includes bacteria as well as blue-green algae. They can be present in extreme habitats such as hot springs, deserts, snow as well as deep oceans. Certain organisms act as parasites also. All monerans are prokaryotes. They do not have the true nucleus, that is, nucleus not surrounded by nuclear membrane. They can be autotrophs, heterotrophs 1 ","as well as parasites. They do have cell wall. There respiration can be aerobic as well as anaerobic. The movement occurs through flagella. Exchange of nutrients or gases occurs by diffusion. Fig.2. Examples of Kingdom Monera They are divided into Archaebacteria and Eubacteria . Archaebacteria Archaebacteria can be thermoacidophiles (hot springs), halophiles (survive in high salt concentration), and methanogens (marshy areas). There structure of cell wall is different from other monerans. Methanogens are found in the gut of some ruminants such as buffaloes and cows. This helps in production of biogas from the dung of the animal. Eubacteria They are referred as “True bacteria”. The presence of motile flagellum and a rigid cell wall characterize them. It includes cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). They are like plants in having chlorophyll a. So, known as photosynthetic autotrophs . Cyanobacteria are unicellular, filamentous algae. They form colonies which are surrounded by gelatinous sheath. Some have specialized structures known as heterocyst which helps in fixing nitrogen. For example, Nostoc . 2 ","Fig.3. Nostoc There are certain bacteria that can oxidize certain inorganic substances such as nitrites, nitrates, they are known as chemosynthetic autotrophs . The energy released during oxidation is used in the production of the ATP. Bacteria can reproduce asexually by fission. They can also reproduce through spores under unfavorable conditions. Monera also includes Mycoplasma . They do not have cell wall and survive in anaerobic conditions. Mycoplasma are the smallest living organisms known. Kingdom Protista Single celled eukaryotes are kept under Protista. They are mostly aquatic in nature. For example, Algae serves as primary producers in aquatic ecosystem. They are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. They have true nucleus, bounded by nuclear membrane. They can move by cilia as well as via flagella. Respiration can be both aerobic as well as anaerobic. Similarly, reproduction can be sexual as well as asexual. They are divided into Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and Protozoans . 1. Chrysophytes It consists of diatoms and golden algae. They can live in freshwater water as well as marine water. Mostly they are photosynthetic. Their cell wall is impregnated with silica. They are the major producers in the oceans. Mostly they are unicellular flagellates. But some are amoeboid. Fig.4. Diatoms 2. Dinoflagellates Dinoflagellates are marine and photosynthetic organisms. They can be of different colors such as yellow, brown, red, or blue in color. The color is due to the presence of different colored pigments present in the cells of the dinoflagellates. The cell wall is made up of cellulose. They are biflagellate with one flagella placed longitudinally and other flagella placed transversely. For example, Gonyaulax catenella , Noctiluca scintillans . 3 ","Fig.5 . Example of dinoflagellates 3. Euglenoids Euglenoids are freshwater organisms that are found in stagnant water. They are surrounded by a protein rich layer known as pellicle. They have one short flagella and one long flagella. They can behave as autotrophic as well as heterotrophic organisms. For example, Euglena . Most of the euglenoids have chloroplast so they can synthesize their own food. The reserve food material found is euglenoids are Paramylon (carbohydrate). Fig.6. Euglena 4. Slime moulds They are saprophytic in nature. Under favorable conditions, they form aggregates which are known as Plasmodium . During unfavorable condition, they form fruiting bodies with spores. They possess true cell walls. They are extremely resistant to adverse conditions. 4 ","5. Protozoan like protists They are heterotrophs. They can live as predators as well as parasites. There are four major types of protozoans found- • Amoeboid protozoans are found in fresh water, moist soil, or sea water. They possess pseudopodia for engulfing the food particles, such as Amoeba . • Flagellated protozoans can be free-living or parasitic. This group of organisms are responsible for different parasitic diseases. For example, Trypanosoma causes sleeping sickness. • Ciliated protozoans possess thousands of cilia. The movement of cilia helps in propelling forward or backward. It also helps in obtaining food from the outside. For example, Paramecium . Fig.7. Paramecium • Sporozoans form reproductive cells which are known as spores. They are parasitic and pathogenic in nature. For example, Plasmodium species causes Malaria. Reproduction can be asexual or sexual. Fig.8. Plasmodium species 5 ","Kingdom Fungi Fungi are heterotrophic in nature. Some acts on dead organic matter and so known as saprophytes. Some can feed on living organisms so known as parasites. Some fungi can live in mutual relationship with other organisms such as algae, they are known as lichens. Such fungi are known as symbionts. Lichens are symbiotic association between the fungi and the algae. Mycorrhiza are the symbiotic association between the fungi and the roots of the higher plants. Reproduction in fungi can occur by- budding, fragmentation, and fission . Asexual reproduction occurs by means of spores known as conidia, zoospores or sporangiospores . Sexual reproduction occurs by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores . There are three steps of sexual cycle in fungi-the first step is the fusion of the protoplasm which is known as plasmogamy . Then, the fusion of nuclei occurs which is known as karyogamy . This results in the formation of the zygote. Then finally, the meiosis of zygote results in the formation of the spores. The vegetative part of the fungus is known as mycelium . The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. During sexual cycle of fungi, two haploid hyphae fuses to form diploid cells. Kingdom fungi is divided into different classes- • Phycomycetes (lower fungi) -Asexual reproduction occurs by motile spores known as zoospores and non-motile spores are known as aplanospores. Spores are produced inside the sporangium. Fusion of gametes give rise to zygospore. Mycelium is coenocytic (multiple nucleus) and multicellular. For example, such as Mucor, Rhizopus, Albugo . Fig.9. Common fungi 6 ","• Ascomycetes (sac fungi)-They can be saprophytic as well as parasitic. Asexual reproduction occurs by conidia. Sexual reproduction occurs through ascospores. Branched and septate mycelium is found in Ascomycetes. For example, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Claviceps etc. Fig.10. Ascomycetes • Basidiomycetes (club fungi)-Vegetative reproduction occurs through fragmentation. Absence of sex organs. Plasmogamy between two vegetative or somatic cells results in the formation of basidium. Basidium undergo karyogamy and meiosis to form four basidiospores. For example, Agaricus (mushrooms), Ustilago (smut) etc. Fig.11. Agaricus • Deuteromycetes are commonly known as imperfect fungi as they do not have sexual reproduction at any stage of the life. The asexual reproduction occurs by conidia. Mycelium is septate and branched. For example, Alternaria, Trichoderma etc. 7 ","• Zygomycetes (conjugation fungi) are primitive group of fungi. Asexual reproduction occurs by non-motile sporangiospores. For example, Rhizopus . Kingdom Plantae It includes all photosynthetic, multicellular, eukaryotic plants. Characteristics of members of Plantae are as follows- • Mostly they are eukaryotic in nature. • The main pigment present is chlorophyll. • Their cell wall is made up of cellulose. • Photosynthesis helps in the synthesis of the food. • Reproduction can be sexual as well as asexual. • They exhibit the phenomenon of alternation of generation, that is, diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte. Kingdom Animalia They are heterotrophic, eukaryotic organisms. Some of the characteristics of members of Animalia are as follows- • They are multicellular organisms with variable size. • They have well developed organ system such as skeleton system, circulatory system, respiratory system etc • They are bilaterally symmetrical. • They have well developed locomotory organs. • Respiration occurs by gills, book lungs, book gills, skin, lungs etc. • Membrane bound cell organelles with nucleus bounded by a nuclear membrane. • Circulation occurs via blood, blood vessels, and heart. • Reproduction occurs by the formation of the haploid gametes. The fusion of gametes give rise to a new diploid organism. • Kidneys are the main respiratory organs. Viruses: They are acellular structures and therefore do not find a place in Whittaker’s five kingdom classification. They consist of a nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA) that is surrounded by a protein coat. They can grow and multiply 8 ","only inside a host cell. Outside the host cell the viruses exist as crystals. They cause diseases and damage to the host. Examples of common viruses are the viruses causing common cod, influenza, polio, AIDS, etc. Viroids : They are the smallest structures known that are capable of infection. They consist only the nucleic acid without the protein coat. Lichens: They are symbiotic associations of algae and fungi. The algal partner is autotrophic and synthesizes and provides food. The fungal partner offers protection and shelter. 9 ","PLANT KINGDOM Whittaker classified the whole living organism into five kingdoms based on the complexity of cell structure (Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic), complexity of body (unicellular and multicellular) and mode of nutrition (autotrophs and heterotrophs). Classification of plant kingdom: All the classification system, starting from that of Aristotle to the 20 th century, can be divided into three types- Artificial, Natural and Phylogenetic. • 1. Artificial system: Classification based on few morphological characters. Theophrastus, Pliny and Linnaeus used artificial system of classification. • 2. Natural system: Classification based on all the important related characters. Both external and internal. Bentham and hooker, Adanson, Candolle used natural system of classification. • 3. Phylogenetic system : Classification based on evolutionary relationship of plants. Eichler, Blessy, Whittaker, Engler and Prantl, Hutchinson used phylogeny. Numerical taxonomy : Taxonomy based on statistical methods with equal importance using computer. Cytotaxonomy: Taxonomy based on cytology or cell structure (chromosome number, shape, behaviour etc). Chemotaxonomy: Taxonomy based on chemical constituents of plants (nature of protein, DNA sequence, taste, smell etc). EICHLERS CLASSIFICATION : Classification of Plant kingdom based on flowering. Divided into two-Cryptogamae (non flowering, seedless plants) and Phanerogamae (flowering, seed bearing plants). Based on plant body Cryptogamae divided into Thallophyta, Bryophyta and Pteridophyta . Thallophyta: Plant body is thallus like (undifferentiated plant body) Bryophyta: plant body with root like structure, stem like structure, vascular tissues are absent). Pteridophyta: Plant body is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves. Vascular tissues are present so called vascular cryptogams. Thallophytes again divided into • 1. Algae (pigmented thallophytes) • 2. Fungi (nonpigmented thallophytes) • 3. Lichens: Symbiotic association between algae and fungi. Phanerogamae divided into two • 1. Gymonosperma (naked seed plants) and • 2.  Angiosperma (covered seeded plants) Angiosperms are again divided into two • 1.Monocots (have single cotyledon, fibrous root system and parallel venation) • 2. Dicots (have two cotyledons, tap root system and reticulate venation). Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms are called Tracheophytes due to the presence of vascular tissue. Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms are called Embryophyta as they have embryo. 3.1 ALGAE: Phycology: Branch of Biology which deals with the study of algae 1 ","Phycos=sea weed Logos=study Fritch – Father of phycology. M.O.P.Iyengar is the father of Indian phycology. Algal members are pigmented thallophytes. Habitat: Hydrophytes: Water is their habitat Xerophytes: In desert habitat Mesophytes- in medium habitat Epiphytes-on plants Lithophytes- on rocks Halophytes- in salty areas. In aquatic habitat-fresh water ( Spirogyra ) and marine ( Sargassum ). Floating- Chlamydomonas, Spirogyra Benthophytes - (attached to the bottom) – Chara (stone worts) Epiphyte-growing on plant body (Cladophora ) Epizoic-growing on animal body ( Trichophillus ) Moist soil-terrestrials ( Fritschiella ). Plant body: The vegetative plant body is a haploid gametophyte. Unicellular, flagellated ( Chlamydomonas ) or non-flagellated ( Chlorella ) Multicellular: a) Coenobium-a colony with fixed number of cells and division of labour. Eg: Volvox b) Aggregation-indefinite colony. Eg: Tetraspora c) Filamentous-unbranched .Eg: Ulothrix d) Filamentous branched. Eg: Cladophora e) Siphonous- multinucleate. Eg: Vaucheria f) Parenchymatous. Eg: Ulva g) Branched like higher plants. Eg: Sargassum, Chara Nutrition : Autotrophs - Photosynthetic (most of them) Parasitic forms (rare). Eg: Cephaleuros . Pigments: • 1. Chlorophyll- a, b, c, d. 2 ","• 2. Carotenoids- carotene and xanthophyll-fucoxanthin (dominating pigment in brown algae). • 3. Phycobillins- phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. Reproduction : Vegetative reproduction- Reproduction using the vegetative parts. Different types are • Fission • Fragmentation • Budding • Tubers • Gemmae. Asexual reproduction-without the fusion of gametes . Mainly by: • Zoospores within sporangia • Aplanospores • Akinete • Hypnospores • Endospore • Exospore • Monospore • Auxospore. Palmella stage -spores become colonial and appear like the algae named Palmella . Eg: Ulothrix, Chlamydomonas . Sexual reproduction: Homogametes-similar gametes Heterogametes-dissimilar gametes • Isogamy: fusion of morphologically and physiologically similar gametes. Isogamy- flagellated ( Chlamydomonas ) and nonflagellated ( Spirogyra ). • Anisogamy: fusion of morphologically or physiologically dissimilar gametes. Morphologically dissimilar – eg: Chlamydomonas Physiologically dissimilar – eg: Spirogyra . • Oogamy - fusion of morphologically and physiologically dissimilar gametes. Small motile male gamete + large nonmotile female gamete. Eg: Fucus, Volvox . Exceptional cases: 3 ","Unicellular antheridium and oogonium .Eg: Oedogonium . Special reproductive structures: Conceptacles – Eg: Sargassum Globule (antheridium) and nucule (oogonium) Eg: Chara Spirogyra has a special type of sexual reproduction called conjugation. The life cycle has two phases-haploid and diploid and some of them exhibit alternation of generation . The haploid phase alternates with the diploid phase. Classification of algae: They are classified into three- • Chlorophyceae • Phaeophyceae • Rhodohyceae. 3.1.1 CHLOROPHYCEAE: The plant body is unicellular as in Chlamydomonas or colonial as in Volvox or filamentous as in Spirogyra . Different shapes for the chloroplast- • Ribbon shaped and spiral in Spirogyra Girdle shaped in Ulothrix • Cup shaped chloroplast in Chlamydomonas 4 ","• Star shaped in Zygnema • Disc shaped in Caulerpa • Reticulate in Oedogonium . 5 ","Photosynthetic pigments are chlorophyll a and b. Store food in the form of starch and some store in the form of oil droplets. Pyrenoids which are the storage bodies are present. Cell wall is made up of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. The members reproduce • Vegetatively by fragmentation • Asexually by flagellated zoospores • Sexually by isogamy, anisogamy and oogamy. Common Chlorophycean members are Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Volvox, Ulothrix, Ulva, Caulrepa, Chara, Acetabularia etc. 3.1.2 Brown algae or Phaeophyceae: They are marine. Simple, branched and filamentous as in Ectocarpus , or flat ribbon shaped in Sargassum, Laminaria, Fucus etc. Kelps which are the giant brown algae are the largest sea plants, some are free floating as in Sargassum and some are epiphytes on other plants like Ectocarpus . Plant body has three parts- • fixing structures called hold fast • stalk like structure called stipe • leaf like structure called frond. Pigments are chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls. Food is stored in the form of laminarin and mannitol which are complex carbohydrates. 6 ","Cell wall is made up of cellulose and is covered by a gelatinous coating called algin on the outer part which is a phycocolloid (hydrocolloid) and they prevents the thallus from drying in low tide. Cell consists of cell organelles and centrally is the vacuole which helps the thallus to float. Vegetative reproduction is by Fragmentation Asexual by biflagellated zoospores which are pear shaped with two flagella attached laterally. Sexual reproduction is by the fusion of gametes- • Isogamy, • Anisogamy • Oogamy. Gametes are pear shaped with 2 laterally attached flagella. The common brown algae are Ectocarpus, Laminaria,Dictyota, Sargassum and Fucus . 3.1.3 RHODOPHYCEAEA (Red Algae): Commonly called as red algae. They are mostly marine and rarely fresh water. Eg: Betrachospermum . They occur in well lighted region and also in depths of oceans. The thallus is multicellular. Pigments present are chlorophyll a, d and phycoerythrin. Red colour is due to the presence of red pigment called r-phycoerythrin. Food is stored in the form of floridean starch which is similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure. Vegetative reproduction by fragmentation Asexual by nonmotile spores Sexual by Oogamy and has complex post fertilization developments. The common red algae are Polysiphonia, Porphyra, Gracilaria, Gelidium, Betrachospermum etc. Economic Importance of algae: 7 ","• Algae are the primary producers in the food chain. They form the basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. • Half of the total carbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae by photosynthesis. • Helps in purification of air and water. • Some are edible. Eg- Chlorella, Spirulina, Laminaria, Porphyra, Sargassum, Ulva • Some are used as fodder. Eg; Laminaria, Sargassum, Fucus . • Food supplement for space travellers like Chlorella, Spirulina , • Hydrocolloids or water holding substances like algin and carrageen are obtained from red algae. • Agar is obtained by Gelidium and Gracilaria . It is used to grow microorganisms. • Used in the preparation of culture media in tissue culture experiments. • Medicinal- Antibiotics. Eg: Chlorella, Polysiphonia . • Source of minerals- Polysiphonia, Laminaria • Biological research: Chlorella, Acetabularia . Common names of algae: • Water silk-Spirogyra • Sea lettuce- Ulva • Umbrella plant-Acetabularia ( Largest unicellular algae) 3.2 Bryophytes: Simplest non vascular land plants with undifferentiated plant body. Bryology-Study of Bryophyta Hedwig- Father of bryology S.R.Kashyap-Father of Indian bryology Bryophytes are known as the amphibians of the plant kingdom. Bryophytes grows in dense patches on the moist shady places like walls, damp soil, tree trunks etc. Features: Habitat: Mainly terrestrial Some are aquatic .E.g- Riccia fluitans Epiphyllous – E.g : Radula Plant body-Thallus like and Prostrate. Eg: Riccia, Anthoceros, Marchantia or Erect. Eg- Moss. Root like structures called rhizoids fix them to the soil. Plant body is differentiated into stem like and leaf like structures. Vascular tissues are absent. Vegetative reproduction by fragmentation, budding, tubers etc. Asexual by Gemmae- asexual buds in liver worts. Sexual reproduction-The vegetative plant body is the gametophyte and all members are homosporous. 8 ","Multicellular sex organs present and are found in clusters. Male reproductive organs is the club shaped antheridium and the female part is the flask shaped archegonium. Anthredium produce biflagellated antherozoids which are motile and archegonium produce the egg. Antherozoid fuses with the egg to form the zygote. The sporophyte is not free living and it derives nourishment from the photosynthetic gametophyte. Haploid spores are formed in the sporophyte after meiosis and the spore germinates to form the gametophyte. Alternation of generation present- haploid phase alters with the diploid phase. Both phases are multicellular. The dominant photosynthetic free living stage is gametophyte. The sporophyte is short lived and depends on the gametophyte. Water is essential for fertilization. Classification of Bryophytes: 3 classes • 1.Hapticospida (liver worts) • 2.Anthocerotopsida (Horn worts) • 3.Bryopsida.(Moss) 3.2.1 Hepaticopsida or Liver worts : Plant body is photosynthetic, flat, dorsiventral thallus .E.g.: Riccia, Marchantia The rhizoids help the thallus to get attached to the soil. Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. E.g.: Riccia, Marchantia In some bryophytes, by the gemmae formation. E.g.: Marchantia Gemmae are green multicellular, asexual buds which develop into small receptacles called gemma cups. It gets detached from the parent body and germinate to form the new thallus. Sexual reproduction: Sex organs are antheridia and archegonia . They are formed either on the same thalli or on different thalli. 9 ","Sporophyte is differentiated into three parts-foot, seta and capsule. Meiosis takes place in the capsule to form the haploid spores which germinate into free living thalloid gametophyte. Antheropsida or Horn worts : E.g.: Anthoceros, Notothylas . Anthoceros is commonly known as hornworts They contain pyrenoids Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is present. 3.2.2 Bryopsida (Moss): They are higher bryophytes The gametophyte consist of two stages-protonema and leafy stage . Protonema are green filamentous, branched, creeping structures directly developed from the spore on germination and they bears branched rhizoids and lateral buds. Leafy stage is developed from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. Plant body consist of root like, stem like and leaf like structures. Eg: Funaria . Rhizoids are multicellular and branched. Leafy stages bears the sex organs. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. Spore dispersal mechanism is elaborate in mosses. Eg: Funaria, Polytrichum, Sphagnum etc. 10 ","Economic Importance • They are food for herbaceous animals. • Sphagnum (Moss) - in form of peat is used as fuel. • It is  also used for trans-shipment of living material because of its water holding capacity • Prevent soil erosion. • Along with lichens they are the first colonizers on barren rocks. • They decompose rocks making substrate for the growth of higher plant (Succession). 3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES: First terrestrial plant possesses vascular tissue like xylem and phloem . So they are known as vascular cryptogams. Commonly known as botanical snake. Plant body differentiated into true root, stem and leaf. Plant body is the sporophytic generation. Stem is rhizomatous and regenerate when aerial parts are destroyed. Leaves may be small ( microphyll ) as in Selaginella or large ( macrophyll ) as in ferns. 11 ","Coiling of youg leaves - Circinate vernation is seen in pteridophytes . Leaves are of two types vegetative and fertile. Fertile leaves are the spore bearing leaves called sporophylls. Spores are formed inside the sporangia. In Sporangia, the spore mother cells give rise to spores after meiosis. Spores germinate to form haploid gametophytic, photosynthetic heart shaped multicellular structure called prothallus which bears antheridia and archegonia. Prothallus requires cool, damp shady areas for growth and water is essential for fertilization. The antheridia bear antherozoids and archegonia bears the egg cell respectively which on fertilization form zygote which on germination forms the sporophyte. Most of pteridophytes produce similar kinds of spores hence called homosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia produce two kind of spores, macro or large spores and small or micro spores and are said to be heterosporous . Microspore and macrospore germinate and gives rise to male and female gametophyte respectively. In heterosporous condition the female gametophyte is not free living, it is retained in the parent sporophyte till the beginning of the embryo development. Seed bearing plants are evolved from heterosporous pteridophyte. 12 ","Pteridophytes further classified into four classes: • Psilopsida ( Psilotum ) • Lycopsida ( Selaginella ) • Sphenopsida ( Equisetum ) • Pteropsida ( Pteris ). Economic importance: Some members are Medicinal- Dryopteris Helps in Soil binding Used as Ornamental plants Edible plants- Marcelia Used in Crop rotation- Azolla Helps in Symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks or soil. Sphagnum is used to keep seedlings in gardens and cut plant parts moist during transportation and propagation. Common names: • Creeping pine/Club moss - Lycopodium • Spike moss(Resurrection plant- Selaginella • Water fern- Azolla (smallest pteridophyte) • Walking fern (Maiden hall fern)- Adiantum • Adder’s tongue fern - Ophioglossum • Fossil pteridophyte- Cooksonia • Leafless Pteridophyte- Psilotum • Horse tail- Equisetum 3.4 GYMNOSPERMS: 13 ","Have naked seeds as the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed (no fruit covering). Flowerless seed bearing plants. Ovules are not enclosed by ovary wall. Dominant plants during the Jurassic period. Gymnosperm includes medium-sized trees or tall trees and shrub. Tap root system is generally present. May be associated with mycorrhiza-Association between fungus and roots of higher plants. Eg: Pinus . Coralloid roots with nitrogen fixing bacteria as in Cycas . Stem is branched ( Pinus ), or unbranched ( Cycas ). Leaves are adapted for extreme temperature, humidity and wind-needle like leaves with thick cuticle, sunken stomata. Eg: Pinus . Leaves may be simple or compound. Stem is unbranched as in Cycas Branched in Pinus and Cedrus Well-developed vascular system – xylem without vessels. REPRODUCTIONS: Sporophylls are aggregated to form strobuli or cone. They are generally monosporangiate or of two types- male and female cones. Male cones are short lived and female ones are long lived. Male strobili or male cone – microsporophylls which bear microsporangia having microspores which develop into reduced gametophyte called pollen grain . Female cone or female strobili – megasporophylls which bear megasporongia having megaspores which are enclosed within the megasporangium (Nucellus). One megaspore develops into female gametophyte bearing two or more archegonia. Pollen grains are carried by wind and reach the ovules. They form pollen tube which reaches the archegonia and release male gametes into the ovule. Fusion of the gametes takes place and zygote is formed which produce embryos. Ovules develop into seeds which are not covered. The endosperms in gymnosperms is a prefertilisation product and haploid in nature. The dominant photosynthetic independent stage is the sporophyte. The gametophyte is single to few celled and not free living. 14 ","Classified into four classes: • 1.Cycadopsida Eg: Cycas • 2. Coniferopsida eg: Pinus • 3. Gnetopsida: Eg: Gnetum . • 4. Gingopsida- Ginko Economic importance: Timbers for furniture, Pulp wood, Pencil box, Musical instruments etc. Production of resins, Turpentine etc.-E.g.-Pinus Edible seeds: Eg- Cycas, Pinus, Ginkgo . Medicinal Eg: Ephedrine from Ephedra (used for respiratory problems) Taxol – from Taxus species to freeze cancer cells. Common names: Maiden hair tree- Ginkgo Sago palm /Panda of the plant kingdom- Cycas 15 ","Largest gymnosperm- Sequoia Smallest gymnosperm- Zamia Gymnosperm with xylem vessels- Ephedra, Gnetum . 3.5 ANGIOSPERMS: Angiosperms are known as flowering plants and have covered seeds . They are divided into two classes – • 1.Dicotyledons (have two cotyledons) • 2. Monocotyledons (have one cotyledon). Smallest angiosperm: Wolfia (microscopic). Large tree: Eucalyptus over 100 meters. Reproductive organs developed in flowers . The Male sex organs in a flower are called stamens or androecium. It has filament and anther . Anthers on meiosis produce pollen grains . Pollen grains have two male gametes. Female reproductive part is the pistil or gynoecium. It has stigma , style and ovary . Ovary has one or many ovule in which female gametophyte ( embryo sac ) develops by meiosis. Embryo sac has 7 cells and 8 nuclei. • 1 egg cell • 2 synergids • 3 antipodal • One central cell having two polar nuclei . 16 ","Pollen grain are carried by various agents like wind, water, birds, insects etc. and reaches the stigma. Pollen grains produces pollen tube which contains two male gametes and enters into the embryo sac. One male gamete fuses with egg cell to form zygote and is called syngamy which develops into embryo. Other male gamete fuses with secondary nucleus (formed by fusion of two polar nuclei) which forms triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN) and is called triple fusion. PEN develops into endosperm which nourishes the developing embryo. As two fertilization (syngamy and triple fusion) takes place inside the embryo sac at the same time, it is called double fertilization. Endosperm is triploid. Ovules develop into seeds and ovaries into fruits. LIFE CYCLE OF ANGIOSPERMS 17 ","3.6 Alternation of generation : There is an alternation of a haploid gamete producing gametophytic and spore producing sporophytic generation. Three types- 1. Haplontic life cycle: In this type the dominant, photosynthetic phase is a free living gametophyte produced by haploid spores. The gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis and the gametes fuse to form the zygote which represents the sporophytic generation. Zygote undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. Here the Gametophytic phase is dominant . e.g., Chlamydomonas . 2.  Diplontic life cycle : Here the diploid sporophyte is the dominant photosynthetic independent phase of the plant. The gametophyic phase is represented by one to few celled haploid gametophyte. Here sporophytic phase is dominant . e.g., Angiosperms and Gymnosperms. 18 ","3. Haplo-Diplontic life cycle : In this type both  haploid and diploid phases are multicellular and often free living. Seen in bryophytes and pteridophytes. Although most algal genera show haplontic life cycle, some of them such as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia , Kelps, etc. exhibit haplo-diplontic life cycle. Fucus a brown alga exhibits diplontic life cycle. FAST TRACK REVISION: 1. Plant Kingdom Divided into two-Cryptogamae (non flowering seedless plants) and Phanerogamae (flowering, seed bearing plants). 2. Based on plant body Cryptogamae divided into Thallophyta, Bryophyta and Pteridophyta. 3. Thallophytes again divided into • 1.Algae (pigmented thallophytes) • 2. Fungi (nonpigmented thallophytes) • 3. Lichens: Symbiotic association between algae and fungi. • 4. Phanerogamae divided into two • 1. Gymonosperma (naked seed plants) and • 2.  Angiosperma( covered seeded plants) 4. Angiosperms are again divided into two • 1.Monocots (have single cotyledon, fibrous root system and parallel venation) • 2. Dicots (have two cotyledons, tap root system and reticulate venation). 6. Algae are simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms. 7. Depending on the type of pigment possessed and the type of stored food, algae are classified into three classes namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, and Rhodophyceae. 8. Vegetative reproduction- fragmentation, asexual - formation of different types of spores and sexually by the formation of gametes which show isogamy, anisogamy and oogamy. 9. Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated than that of algae. 10. Thallus like plant body, prostrate or erect, and fixing structures are called rhizoids. They possess root like, leaf like, and stem like structures. 11. The bryophytes are divided into liver worts, hornworts and mosses. 12. Liverworts have thalloid plant body and dorsiventral. 13. Mosses have upright and slender axis bearing spirally arranged leaves. 14. The plant body is a gametophyte and after fusion of the gametes the zygote produce a multicellular body called the sporophyte. 15. In pteridophytes, plant body is a sporophyte with root, stem and leaves. 16. The sporophyte in Pteridophyte bear sporangia which produce spores which on germination form gametophyte. 17. Gametophyte in Pteridophyte bears male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia. 18. Water is needed for fertilization. 19. The gymnosperms are the plants which produce naked seeds. After fertilization the seed remains exposed. 20. Gymnosperms produce microsporophyll and megasporophyll. Microsporangia and Megasporangia are borne on the sporophylls. 21. Sporophylls-Microsporophyll and megasporophyll. 22. The pollen tube produced by the pollen grain releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it fuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilization, the zygote develops into embryo and the ovules into seeds. 19 ","23. In angiosperms, the male sex organs or stamen and the female sex organ the pistil are born in a flower. 24. Stamen consists of anther and filament. 25. Pistil contains ovary, style and stigma. 26. The pollen grain produces two male gametes. One male gamete fuses with the egg and is called syngamy and forms zygote which develops to form the embryo. 27. The other male gamete fuses with the polar nuclei and is called triple fusion and forms the primary endosperm nucleus which develops to form the endosperm which gives nourishment for the developing embryo. 28. As two fertilization are taking place inside the embryo sac at the same time – syngamy and triple fusion, it is called double fertilization. 29. Angiosperms are divided into two classes-Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons. 20 ","ANIMAL KINGDOM Animal kingdom shows a great diversity of life in comparison with the plant kingdom. All animals are metazoans (multicellular, eukaryotic, and heterotrophic animals). 4.1 Basis of Classification : Classification is based on their features like • Arrangement of cells • Level of body organisation • Body symmetry • Nature of coelom • Patterns of digestive, circulatory or reproductive systems. 4.1.1 LEVELS OF ORGANISATION It exhibits considerable variation among animals. Following are the major types • Cellular level. Cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates. It shows no co-ordination to form tissues. Individual cells are capable of performing specific functions. E.g.: sponges • Tissue level. Cells performing similar function are aggregated to form tissues. E.g.: Coelenterates (hydra) • Organ level. Tissues are grouped together to form organs. Each organ is assigned to execute specific function. Eg: Platyhelminthes and other higher phyla • Organ system level. A group of organs working together as a larger unit is called an organ system Organ system exists in various patterns as illustrated below Digestive system In animals, the mouth, tongue, teeth, salivary glands, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, gall bladder, bile ducts and pancreas together constitute the digestive system. It is of two types • Incomplete: digestive system has only a single opening to the outside of the body. It acts as both anus and the mouth. Eg: Platyhelminthes and Coelenterates • Complete: The digestive system has two separate openings at each end, the mouth and the anus. Eg: Man Circulatory system: It is of two types. • Open type : blood is pumped out of the heart, and the tissues are bathed in it. Eg: arthropods and molluscs • Closed type: Blood flows inside blood vessels of varying diameters (arteries, veins, capillaries) without coming in direct contact with body cells. Eg: in many invertebrates (cephalopods), and all vertebrates 4.1.2 SYMMETRY Arrangement of body parts on the sides of the main median axis of the body. This idea was given by Haeckel. Animals exhibits 3 types of symmetry • Asymmetry: Body cannot be divided in to two equal halves through any plane passing through centre. Eg: sponges 1 ","• Radial symmetry: Body can be cut into two exact halves through any plane which pass through the central axis. Such animals have two ends in the main body axis the oral and aboral end, but no left and right sides. Eg: Coelenterates, Ctenophora and Echinodermata • Bilateral symmetry: Body can be divided into two identical halves only through a single plane passing through central axis. These animals have a front and rear end. They also have an upper and lower side. They have equivalent left and right lateral sides. Eg: Annelids, Arthropods, etc 4.1.3 DIPLOBLASTIC AND TRIPLOBLASTIC ORGANISATION This classification is based on number of embryonic cell layers and divided into two: • Diploblastic: Cells are arranged into two embryonic layers, i.e. outer ectoderm and inner endoderm and a middle undifferentiated mesoglea. Eg: Coelenterates and Sponges • Triploblastic : Three embryonic layers are present i.e. .outer ectoderm, middle mesoderm and inner endoderm. All the tissues and organs are formed from these three layers. Ectoderm give rise to epidermis and nervous system etc., mesoderm to muscles, endoskeleton, reproductive organs, coelom, etc, and endoderm to the alimentary canal, lungs, etc. • Eg:Platyhelminthes 4.1.4 COELOM The fluid filled body cavity in between the body wall and the digestive tract of animals is called the coelom .The coelom is lined by mesodermal epithelium on either side. All the internal organs are suspended in the coelom. The coelom allows greater body flexibility . It acts as a shock absorber . In soft bodied animals it protects internal organs from external shocks. In some animals it acts as an internal skeleton. E.g.: earthworm Animals are divided in to 3 groups on the basis of nature of coelom. • Acoelomates: Body cavity is absent and coelomic space is occupied by parenchyma like cells. 2 ","Eg: Platyhelminthes • Pseudocoelomates : Animals having false coelom. Body cavity is not formed from the mesodermal epithelium. Mesoderm appears as scattered pouches in between ectoderm and endoderm. In these animals pseudocoelom is formed from the embryonic cavity called blastocoel. Eg: Aschelminthes • Coelomates or Eucoelomates : Animals with true body cavity Eg: Annelids, Molluscs, Arthropods, Echinoderms, Hemichordates, and Chordates. 4.1.5 SEGMENTATION In some animals the entire length of body is transversely divided in to a number of ring like parts called segments. This phenomenon of segmentation is called metamerism . This pattern is clearly seen in annelids like earthworm and arthropods like millipedes and centipedes. In earthworms the segmentation helps in locomotion. In arthropods the metameric segments may be paired appendages for various functions such as legs for locomotion, antennae for sensory functions and mouth for feeding etc. In insects, these metameric segments are grouped to form body regions like head, thorax, and abdomen. 4.1.6 NOTOCHORD It is a mesodermally derived rod like structure present dorsally during embryonic development It is a stiff and flexible rod of tissue running along the dorsal side below the nerve cord and above the alimentary canal. Based on the presence or absence of notochord, animals are classified in to 2 groups • Chordates : Animals with notochord. In chordates, the notochord is present at some stage in their life. eg: fishes, birds, mammals, etc. • Non-chordates: Animals without notochord. Eg: Porifera to Echinoderms. • They do not possess the notochord at any stage of their life. 3 ","4.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS The animal kingdom includes about 3 phyla, of which 11 are considered as major phyla and others are categorised as minor phyla. Almost 99% of animals are invertebrates. Based on common fundamental features, the kingdom Animalia is broadly classified into 11 phyla. • Porifera • Coelenterata • Ctenophora • Platyhelminthes • Aschelminthes • Annelida • Arthropoda • Mollusca • Echinodermata • Hemichordata • Chordata. 4.2.1 PHLYUM PORIFERA (porus-opening; fere-to bear) It is the group of the most primitive animals popularly called sponges. These were recognised as animals by ELLIS. The term porifera was introduced by ROBERT GRANT. The study of sponges called PARAZOOLOGY . Most of them are marine and remain attached to rocks. Some lives in fresh water. Spongilla is a freshwater sponge. 4 ","Important characteristic features: • They are sedentary in habitat and are solitary or colonial. They possess a cellular level of organisation. Cells aggregate to form body plan. • Most of them are asymmetrical animals while some are radially symmetrical. • They are pore bearing animals and their body is perforated by numerous openings or pores called OSTIA . • Body wall : Have two loosely differentiated layers of cells. An outer dermal layer of flat cells called pinacocytes and an inner layer of flagellated cells called as collar cells or choanocytes . They are diploblastic. • Water transport system(water canal system): Body is in the form of a cylinder which encloses a large cavity called spongocoel . Spongocoel opens out by a narrow opening called osculum . This pathway helps them in food gathering, respiratory exchange, and removal of waste. Ostia or pores (water enters) → spongocoel (central cavity) → osculum or pores (water goes out). • Choanocytes : Each ostium leads to a canal which leads to spongocoel . The canal is lined with flagellated collar cells called choanocytes. It brings food and oxygen and carries away excretory and reproductive products. Each choanocyte has long flagellum projecting from the free end of each cell. The lower part of the flagellum is surrounded by a transparent collar. In simple sponges the canal is not well developed. In such cases the ostia open in to the spongocoel through hollow cells called porocytes and the spongocoel is lined with choanocytes. 5 ","• In between the two layers of the body there is a non – living gelatinous matrix called mesenchyme. The mesenchyme has a number of amoeboid cells, spicules, and sponging fibres. Amoeboid cells: wander through the matrix carrying food between the cells. Spicules: are siliceous or calcareous structures formed of silica or calcium carbonate. Sponging fibres: are silk elastic structures. • Skeleton : it is made up of spicules and sponging fibres. • Sponges are holozoic (take solid food) in nutrition. The digestion is intracellular. • Reproductive system : they are hermaphrodites (sexes are not separate) Reproduces both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction takes place by fragmentation and budding. Fresh water sponges during unfavourable conditions produce buds known as gemmules which remain dormant till favourable season. Sexual reproduction : during sexual reproduction some amoeboid cells become egg or sperm. Fertilisation is internal and the development of larva is indirect. After fertilisation the zygote develops in to a larva. The larva of sponges are ciliated and free swimming. They are of 2 types: amphiblastula and parenchymula. • All sponges possess great power of regeneration. • Examples for common sponges are Leucosolenia, Spongilla (fresh water sponge), Sycon (scypha), Euspongia (bath sponge), Eupelectella (venus flower basket).Its dried skeleton is used as a costly marriage gift in japan. It is considered a symbol of union till death . Hyalonema (glass rope sponge), Cliona (sulphur sponge), Chalina (dead man finger sponge), Proterion (neptunes cup) are some more examples. 6 ","Classification of Porifera Class I: Calcarea (calcareous sponges. eg: Sypha, Leucosolenia , etc.) ClassII: Demospongia (skeleton of sponging fibres. Largest class of sponges. Eg: Euspongia , Spongilla , etc. ClassIII: Hexactinellida (glass sponges with silicious spicules. eg : Euplectella, Hyalonema , etc. 4.2.2 PHYLUM COELENTERATA Animals belonging to the phylum coelenterata are commonly called coelenterates or Cnidarians. They are more advanced than sponges in having true tissues. It includes about 9000 species. They are aquatic. Most of them are marine. Hydra is a fresh water form Important characteristic features • They are sessile or free swimming. • They exhibit a tissue level of organisation. • Acoelomates • Radially symmetrical. But sea anemone is biradially symmetrical. • Body wall : Diploblastic (outer ectoderm, inner endoderm and middle mesoglea) • Body cavity : A central gastro vascular cavity or coelenteron which opens out through mouth or hypostome . Anus is absent. Body cavity does both digestion and circulation of food. 7 ","Coelenterates are holozoic and carnivorous in nutrition. . • Digestion : it is intracellular and extracellular. Mouth is surrounded by many finger like structures called tentacles . It is used for food capture and defence. • Cnidoblasts : Certain ectodermal cells are modified into stinging cells or cnidodoblasts or cnidocytes, hence the name Cnidaria. Each cnidoblast possesses a stinging capsule called nematocyst containing poisonous fluid. Cnidoblasts are defensive cells used to kill or paralyse other prey and enemies. They are mainly found on the tentacles. The nematocyst poison of Physalia is a neurotoxin • Phylum includes two distinct types of individual. Polyp : sedentary, with a tubular body and mouth surrounded by circlet of tentacles. It represents the asexual stage. Eg: Hydra and Adamsia . Medusa : free floating with a soft, transparent bell like body with tentacles at the margin. Umbrella like. Mouth at the centre of concave surface which is directed downward. It represents the sexual stage. 8 ","Medusa can be regarded as an upside down polyp. Eg : Aurelia In hydra medusa stage is absent. It reproduces sexually in the polyp stage. • Reproduction : asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction : It takes place by budding in polyp and gives rise to medusa. During sexual reproduction , medusa liberates gametes into water. After fertilisation; the zygote develops into a larva. Larvae of cnidarians are ciliated and free swimming. They are called planula. The planula grows into sessile polyp. Coelenterates exhibit alternation of generation in their life cycle. In coelenterates which exist in both forms (polyp and medusa), the asexual polyp generation alternates with sexual medusa generation. Eg: Obelia 9 ","• Polymorphism : many colonial cnidarians exhibit this phenomenon where the individuals (zooids) of the colony show morphological and functional differentiation. Eg: Halistemma, Physalia etc. • Examples of common coelenterates are Hydra, Obelia (sea fur), Aurelia (jelly fish), Physalia (potuguese man of war), Adamsia (sea anemone), Vallela (sail by wind), Fungia (mushroom coral), Astraea (star coral), Pennatula (sea pen), Gorgonian (sea fan), Madrepora (stag horn coral), Meandrina (brain coral), Corallium (red coral), Porpita . Classification of coelenterata Class I: Hydrozoa (both polyp and medusa form occur. eg: Hydraobelia, Physalia ,  etc) Class II: Scyphozoa (only medusa form occurs. eg: Aurelia) Class III: Anthozoa (only polyp form occurs. eg: Adamsia, Fungia, Astraea, Pennatula, Gorgonia, Madrepora, Meandrina, Corallium ,etc. 10 ","4.2.3 P HYLUM CTENOPHORA (Ktene-comb; phors-bearing) This phylum was first recognized by Eschololz in 1928. It includes only small group of animals (50 species). The animals belonging to the phylum are commonly called sea walnuts or comb jellies. Important characteristic features: They are free swimming or pelagic. They are marine animals. Body is soft gelatinous and transparent. They are acoelomates and have the property of bioluminescence . Symmetry: They are radially symmetrical (arrangement of comb plates gives the appearance of radial symmetry) but the tentacles and branching of gastro vascular cavities show bilateral symmetry. So some zoologist explain it is as biradial symmetry Diploblastic organism and exhibit tissue level of organization . Comb plates: animal body bears 8 external rows of cilia. Cilia in each row join together to form comb plates . The ciliary movements of comb plates help in locomotion. Tentacles: a pair of long, retractile tentacles arise from blind pouches in opposite sides of the body, tentacles bear colloblast or collocytes which help in food capture. Digestion: it is both extracellular and intracellular. Statocyst: a peculiar sense organ seen in opposite end of the mouth. It helps in equilibrium . 11 ","Reproduction: sexually only. They are hermaphrodites. Fertilization is external. Development include Cydipid larva. Common ctenophores are Pleurobrachia (sea-gooseberry), Ctenoplana, Cestum (venus girdle), Hormiphora, Beroe . 4.2.4 PHYLUM PLATYHELMINTHES (Platys-flat;helmins-worms) Platyhelminthes was introduced by GEGENBAUR . They are commonly called as flatworms. There are about 13 , 000 species of flatworms known today. Shape of the body is generally dorsi -ventrally flat , Hence the name flatworm . This is the first group of animals in which anterior part is developed into a head. Important characteristic features: • First group of animals to have an organ system level of organization. • Parasitic adaptations : Presence of hooks and suckers. • Bilaterally symmetrical with dorsal and ventral surfaces. First group of animals that show bilateral symmetry. • Triploblastic animals: it is the first group of animals to possess 3 germ layers . • Acoelomate animals : The space between the body cavity and alimentary canal is filled with loose parenchyma cells (mesenchyma cells) originated from mesoderm. 12 ","• Alimentary canal: It is branched.

PLANTS Morphology is the study of external structure of organisms. It involves the study of the size, shape, and structure of all living organisms and their relationships with their constituent parts. The term anatomy refers to the study of internal biological structure. It usually involves study of the details of either gross or microscopic structure. Epidonomy: The study of external morphology or external appearance of an organism such as shape, size, colour, pattern, structure, etc. Anatomy: The study of internal morphology or form and structure of internal parts like bones, organs, etc. Root system: The underground parts of a flowering plant Shoot system: The parts of a flowering plant that are above the soil Roots Radicle . comes . out . from . the . seed . coat . in . the . form . of . soft . structure . and it moves . towards the . soil. It develops . and . shapes . primary . root. Primary root: It is formed as a direct elongation of the radicle in most dicotyledonous plants. It grows inside the soil. It bears lateral roots of several orders like secondary, tertiary, etc. roots. Lateral roots: They extend horizontally from the primary root (radicle) and serve to anchor the plant securely into the soil. The lateral roots help in uptake of water and nutrients required for the growth and development of the plant. 1 ",". [ . Image . source:google . images] . Types . of . Root:-- Roots . are . of . three . types: 1. Tap . root . 2. Fibrous . root 3. Adventitious root Tap root system: The primary root is large, central, and dominant root in taproot system. From the primary root other roots sprout laterally. This root system is generally tapering in shape and grows directly downward . It is common in dicot plants. Fibrous root: It consists of thin, moderately branching roots growing from the base of the stem. The primary root is not prominent and is replaced by a large number of roots. The fibrous root systems appears as a thick tuft of roots forming a mat-like structure at maturity. It is universal in monocotyledonous plants and ferns. 2 ","Adventitious roots: a root that arises from any point on the plant other than the radicle or the root axis. For example, prop roots of banyan, corn, aerial roots of Monstera , etc. These roots are mainly involved in absorption of water and minerals from the soil, providing additional anchorage to the plant parts, storage of reserve food material and synthesis of plant growth hormones. 5.1.1: Regions of the Root Root cap: Protective covering of the root apex. It protects the tender root tip as it makes its way through the soil. Region of meristematic activity: Present a few millimetres above the root cap. It consists of small thin-walled cells with dense protoplasm. They divide repeatedly. Region of elongation: It is proximal to the region of meristematic activity where the cells undergo rapid elongation and enlargement. They are help the root to grow in length. Region of maturation: It is proximal to the region of elongation. Here the cells gradually differentiate and mature. Root hairs: Very fine and delicate, thread-like structures formed by some epidermal cells in the region of maturation. These root hairs aid in absorption of water and minerals from the soil Regions of the root tip 5.1.2: Modification of . Roots:- Roots of some plants modify their shape and structure to adapt for additional functions. Rather than absorption and conduction of water they perform additional functions like support, storage of food and respiration. • Storage roots: The primary tap roots are modified for storage of reserve food materials. The secondary roots remain thin. They absorb water and minerals. The storage roots swell up and assume various forms such as conical ( carrot ), fusiform or spindle shape ( raddish ), napiform or spherical ( turnip, beet ), tuberous (4 o’clock plant ). 3 ","• Respiratory roots: The plants which grow in marshy areas develop branches of root that come out of the ground and grow vertically upward. This occurs as there is scarcity of oxygen in such places. These roots are called pneumatophores . Through these roots air moves inside the plant and cells get oxygen for cellular respiration. Eg. Rhizopora • Prop roots: Roots that arise from the higher nodes or branches of stem of certain plants to provide extra support. Such stems are usually tall and slender and the prop roots develop at successively higher levels as the stem elongates. This is seen in banyan. • Adventitious Root modifications: When adventitious roots are modified for various functions. • Adventitious root modified for storage: They are swollen and take up various shapes to accommodate the stored and reserve food like tuberous, fibrous, nodulose, beaded, etc. 4 ","• Stilt roots: Supporting roots that arise from lower nodes of the stem that are used to provide additional support as in the case of maize. • Climbing roots: Roots arise from nodes that help weak stemmed plants in climbing up with help of support as in the case of money plant. • Foliar roots: Roots arising from leaves as in case of Bryophyllum . 5 ","• Haustorial roots: Seen in parasitic plants. These roots pierce through the host tissue an suck out the nutrients as in Cuscuta . STEM The part of the plant that shows negative geotropic growth and lies above the soil is the stem. It bears nodes and internodes. Nodes are portions that bear leaves, branches, buds, etc. Internodes are portions that occur between two nodes. Buds and branches may be terminal or axillary . Main function is to spread out branches bearing leaves, flowers and fruits. Additionally it transports food, water and minerals. Some stems are modified for storage, photosynthesis, support, protection and vegetative propagation. . [ . Image . source:google . images] . Modification . of . stem: A . -. Sub . -. Aerial .

Inflorescence Arrangement . of . flower . on . shoot . or . peduncle . system . of . a . plant . is . called . inflorescence. Racemose-The main axis continues to grow and does not terminate in a flower. Flowers are arranged acropetally where old flowers are arranged on the lower side and the younger flowers are on the upper side. This . is . of . following . different . types . : 1. . Raceme . -When . peduncle . or . (main . axis) . is . elongated . and . flowers . are . pedicellate. Eg. . Mustard, . Raddish . Gulmohar,Amaltas, . Cassia . simea. 2. . Spike . -.

Spadix . - In it peduncle is thick, long and fleshy that has small sessile and unisexual flowers covered with green or colourful bracts. E.g - Colocasia, Musa , Maize 5. . Corymb In it the peduncle is short. All flowers are present at the same level because the lower flowers have longer pedicels than the upper flowers. E.g- Candytuft ( Iberis amara ) 6. . Umbel . -. An . inflorescence . in . which . the . flower . stalks . of . more . or . less . equal . length . arise . from . the . same . point. . At . the . base . of . flower . stalk, . there . is . whorl . of . bracts . forming . the . involucure. . Eg. . Cantella . 14 ","An umber inflorescence with branched peduncle with each branch forming a flower cluster at the apex is called compound umbel. E.g- Coriander. 7. . Capitulum -. The peduncle is short and becomes broad, flattened, concave or convex. It bears numerous small sessile flowers called florets. If the flowers in the capitulum are all similar then it is called homogamous. In centripetal arrangement younger flowers are arranged towards the centre and the older obes towards the periphery. The central flowers are called disc florets and the peripheral flowers are called ray florets. This type of arrangement is heterogamous as the flowers are dissimilar. The florets may be unisexual, bisexual or sterile. The inflorescence is surrounded by one or more involucre. Eg. Helianthus, Launaea . Cymose The peduncle terminates in a flower. The older flowers are present in the upper regions and the younger flowers are arranged towards the base. Such an arrangement is called basipetal. It . is . of . following . types . - 1. . Uniparous . cyme . -. The . peduncle . ending . in . a . flower . producing . lateral . branch. . It . is . two . types . - (a) . Helicoid . cyme . -When . all . lateral . branches . develop . on . the . same . side . on . peduncle . . Eg. . Heliotropism (b) . Scorpiod . cyme . -The lateral branches lie opposite and alternate to each other. E.g. Begonia, Hamelia 2. . Dischasial . or . biparous . cyme- Peduncle ends in a flower and from the basal part of the peduncle two lateral branches arise which also end in a flower. E.g. Gypsophylla, Sponaria, Dianthus 3. . Multiparous . cyme . -. Peduncle ends in a flower. From the base manu lateral branches arise that also terminate in flowers. E.g- Calotropis 15 ","Special . Type . of . Inflorescence . - 1. . Cyathium Bracts or involucre fuse to form a cup shaped structure on the margins of which secretory glands are found. The central portion of the cup-shaped structure contain female flowers which mature earlier and emerge out of the cup due to the pedicel growth. They are surrounded by small male pedicellate flowers. Male flowers towards the centre mature earlier than those present on the periphery. It is seen in Euphorbiaceae famile like Euphorbia, Poinsettia, Pedilanthus. 2. . Verticillaster . -. Leaves are arranged in opposite manner on the stem. From the axils of the leaves branches as well as inflorescence arise. The inflorescence is dichasial cyme that changes into monochasial cyme. It is seen in Labiaceae. 3. . Hypanthodium . -. Peduncle is modified into a narrow cup-like structure. Female flower develops towards the base of the cup whereas male flowers develop towards the mouth. E.g- Banyan, Peepal FLOWER Flower arises at the axil of the bract. Flower may be borne on a long or short stalk called as the pedicel. The upper part of the pedicel is swollen into spherical or conical shape and is called as the thalamus. The four types of floral leaves are: (i) . Sepal (ii) . Petal (iii) . Stamen (iv) . Carpel 16 ","Symmetry . of . flower Cyclic flower: Floral leaves are cyclically arranged in a flower. Spiral/Acyclic flower: Floral leaves are arranged in a spiral or an acyclic manner. 1. . Actinomorphic . - Flower can be divided into two equal halves along any vertical plane. E.g: mustard. 2. . Zygomorphic . - Flower can be divided into two equal halves only along one vertical plane. The plane could be median ( Ocimum ) or lateral 3. . Asymmetrical . - Flower cannot be divided into two equal halves along any plane. E.g- Canna 17 ","Note . :- (i) . Anthophore . -.

Petaloid . bract . - Bracts are larger than flowers and have various colours. Glumes . -. Small, . dry, . scaly . bracts . are . called . Glumes. . Eg. . Wheat . Grass Calyx . - Outermost whorl of flower. Each member is called sepal. Polysepalous: When the sepals are free from each other. E.g- mustard, raddish Gamosepalous: When the sepals are fused with each other. E.g- cotton, Datura, brinjal 1. . In . calyx . of . Mussaenda , . one of the sepals enlarges to form a leaf-like structure which may be white or brightly coloured. It attracts insects and thus acts as advertisement flag. 2. . In . Trapa , . calyx . is modified . into . spines . and . helps . in . protection . of . fruit. 3. . In . Aceoniteem . spines . are . present . on . the . surface . of . sepal . which . protect . the . flower . bud. 4. In larkspur an balsalm, posterior part of sepal is modified into a narrow tube called as sepal spur which stores nectar. 5. . In sunflower family, sepals are modified into a hairy structure called pappus which helps in fruit dispersal. Duration . of . Sepals 1. . Sepals that fall at the opening of the flower are called cauduceus sepals. E.g- poppy 2. . In . some . plants, . sepals . fall . after . pollination . than . these . are . called . deciduous. 3. . When sepals do not fall and remain attached to the fruits then they are persistent. E.g- tomato, capsicum, brinjal, cotton, datura Epicalyx: Whorl beneath the calyx that is similar to sepals present in some plants. E.g- Malvaceae Corolla The second whorl of the flower lying above the calyx. Each member is called a petal. Petals with similar shape and size are symmetrical. Petals which differ is size and shape are asymmetrical. When petals are free they are called polypetalous whereas when the petals are fused they are called gamosepalous. Forms . of . corolla . - A. . Polypetalous i. . Cruciform- 4 petals are present and arranged crosswise. Lower part of the petal is narrow and is called as the claw whereas the upper part is called as the limb. E.g- raddish, mustard. ii. . Caryophyllaceous . -. It . consists . of . 5 . petals. .

Tubular . -. 5 gamopetalous petals form tubular or cylindrical structure. E.g- disc florets of sunflower iv. . Rotate -5 gamopetalous petals fuse to form a small tube and the petals are arranged in a whorl above the tube. E.g- brinjal Zygomorphic . polypetallous . corolla . - Papilionaceous- There are 5 free petals. Posterior petal is the largest and called as standard or vexillum. Vexillum is covered by two lateral petals called as wings. The innermost basal petals unite to form a keel or carina that covers the lateral petals. E.g- members of papillionaceae like grams . Bilabiate . -. Gamopetalous corolla is divided into two lips and the place between the lips is called as corolla mouth. E.g- Ocimum Personate . -. Bilabiate corolla but the two lips are close to each other. E.g- Antirrhinum iii. . Ligulate . -. Upper part of corolla os long and flattened and attached to a short narrow tube. E.g- ray florets of sunflower. Aestivation . -. Arrangement of sepals and petals in calyx and corolla is called as aestivation. . It . is . of . following . types . : 1. . Valvate . - Petals lie adjacent to each other barely touching. E.g- oak, mustard 2. . Twisted . -. One part of the petal covers the adjacent petal and the other part is automatically covered by the posterior petal. E.g- cotton, ladyfinger 3. . Imbricate . -Both margins of one petal are covered by two other petals the remaining petals arrange in twisted aestivation. E.g- Cassia, Caesalpina 4. . Vexillary . -. Vexillum covers two lateral petals and the lateral petals cover the anterior petals. It is seen in the pea family 20 ","Attachement . of . filament . to . anther . lobe This . attachement . of . filament . to . another . lobe . is . of . 4 . type . : 1. . Adnate -Filament runs the entire length of the anther from the base to the apex. E.g- Michelia (Champa), tobacco. 2. . Basifixed . -. Filament . is . attached . to . anther . at . its . base. . Eg. .

Versatile -Filament is attached to the back of the anther at a single point so that the anther can swing freely. E.g- wheatgrass, maize. Cohesion . of . stamens . : Fusion of floral parts of similar species is called cohesion. When stamens are free then it is polyandrous. 1. . Monoadelphous . -. Anthers are free but filaments are united into a single bundle forming a tube around the gynoecium called as the staminal tube. E.g- cotton, hollyhock, ladyfinger. 2. . Diadelphous - Anthers remain free but the filaments unite in two bundles. Like in pea, gram, etc. of the 10 stamens 9 filaments are fused together and 1 remains free. 3. . Polyadelphous . -When . filaments . are . united . in more . than . two . bundles. . Eg. . Castor, . Lemon. 21 ","Synandrous . -. When . anther . as . well . as . filaments . of . stamens . are . united . through . their . whole . length. Eg.colocasia, . Alocasia,Momordica. 5. . Syngenesious . -. In . it . only . anthers . are . united . in . bundle . but . filament . remain . free.

Gulmohar . 22 ","COHESION OF OVULE . (CARPEL): Flower may be monocarpous (1 carpel) or polycarpous (more than 1 carpel). Polycarpous flowers may be apocarpous (separate carpels) or syncarpous (fused carpels). The degree of cohesion varies. 1. . Many carpels are present and fused but the stigma and style are separated from each other. E.g- Dianthus, Plumbago 2. . Ovary may be fused with style but the stigma is free. E.g- Hibiscus rosasinensis 3. . When . stigma . are . fused . but . the . carpel . and . style . are . free. . eg. . Calotropis, . Casis, . Fistula, . Nerium . 4. . Carpels are completely fused. This is seen in most flowers. E.g- mustard. Raphanus sativus, Lycopersicon In . syncarpous . gynoceium . number of . carpels . fused can . be . detected . through- (i). . No . of . stigma . (ii) . No. . of . style . (iii) . No. . of . lobes . of . ovary . (iv) . No. . of . placenta Placentation . :- Ovules attach to the ovary walls through one or more cushioned structures called placenta. The arrangement of placenta on the ovary wall is called placentation. It is of following types: 1. . Axile- Seen in multicarpellary syncarpous gynoecium. The margins of the carpels fuse to form central axis forming multichambered ovary. Number of chambers is equal to number of ovules. E.g- Potato, china rose, onion. 2. . Free . central . -. Seen in syncarpous gynoecium ovary is unilocular and ovules are borne from the central septa. This . placenation . is . of . 2 . types . : i. . Axile in the beginning but the walls of the chamber are destroyed after some time. ii. . Superficial . -. This . type . of . placentation . is . found . in . multicarpellary . syncarpous . gynoceium. The . ovules . are . attached . on . the . walls . of . locules. . Eg. . Nymphae . (Water . lilly). iii. . Basal . -. The . ovary . is . unilocular . and . a . single . ovule . is . borne . at . the . base . of . ovary . Eg. . Sunflower. Fruit Fleshy structure protecting the ovules. However some fruits like grapes and banana may lack seeds as they are parthenocarpic or seedless fruits. Pericarp . : After ripening the ovarian wall changes into pericarp which may be thick and fleshy or thick and hard or thin and soft. Pericarp . is . made . up . of . 3 . layers . : a. . Outermost . layer . = . Epicarp b. . Middle . layer . = . Mesocarp c. . Innermost . layer . = . Endocarp a. . Epicarp- Outermost thin layer which forms the outermost layer of the fruit called rind. b. . Mesocarp -It . is . the . middle . layer . which . is . thick . and . fleshy . in . mango, . peach, . date . palm. . In . coconut, this . layer . is . made . up . of . fibers . which . is . also . called . coir. 23 ","c. . Endocarp The innermost layer which may be thin and membranous (e.g- Orange, date) or thick and hard.(e.g-mango, coconut) True . fruit . : Fruit developed only from ovary.

On . the . above . two . basis, . fruits . are . divided . into . : 1. . Simple . 2. Aggregate . 3. . Composite Seed: The ovule forms the seed after fertilization. It consists of an embryo enclosed within a seed coat. The embryo consists of the plumule (shoot initial), the radicle (root initial) and cotyledons. If there are 2 cotyledons then the seed is dicotyledonous or dicot and if there is only 1 cotyledon then the seed is monocotyledonous or monocot. Structure of a dicot seed: Seed Coat: It consists of the outer layer testa and the inner layer tegmen. Hilum: It represents the point of attachment of the seed to the fruit Micropyle: A small opening above the hilum Cotyledons: Two in number they are bean shaped, fleshy and filled with reserve food. Embryonal axis: It bears the plumule and radicle on either end and it gives rise to the sapling. Structure of a Monocot Seed: Seed coat is membranous and fused with the fruit wall. They are usually endospermic. Endosperm is fleshy and stores food. It is separated from the embryo by a proteinaceous aleurone layer. Embryo is small and consists of a single reduced cotyledon called as scutellum and the embryonal axis. Embryonal axis is short and bears the plumule and radicle on either end. Plumule and radicle are covered by protective sheaths coleoptile and coleorhiza respectively. 24 ","Semi-Technical . Description . of . a . Typical . Flowering .

This is based on ability of the cells to divide. • The cells of meristematic tissues are capable of division while the cells of permanent tissues do not generally divide further. 1. Meristematic tissues • Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialized regions of active cell division called meristems • Plants have different kinds of meristems. • On the basis of their origin, meristems are of two types-primary & secondary. Primary meristem • Primary meristem are present early in the life of a plant forms the primary plant body • Primary meristem is of two types: apical &intercalary meristem. i) Apical meristem • The meristems present at the shoot and root tips. • They produce primary tissues. • There are two types of apical meristem: shoot apical meristem & root apical meristem . • Root apical meristem : Present at root tips • Shoot apical meristem : Present at the shoot tip. • Some cells left behind from shoot apical meristem during the formation of leaves and elongation of stem, constitute the axillary bud . • Such buds are present in leaf axils and can form a branch or a flower. 1 ","ii) Intercalary meristem • The meristem present between mature tissues is called intercalary meristem. • They are seen in grasses. Their function is to regenerate parts destroyed by the grazing herbivores. Secondary meristems The meristems present in the differentiated regions of roots and shoots plants are called the secondary or lateral meristem. They increase the girth of the stem and usually give rise to woody axis. They are formed later than primary meristem. • Examples of lateral meristems include fascicular vascular cambium, interfascicular cambium and cork cambium. • These produce secondary tissues. 2 ","Permanent tissues • The cells that are differentiated from meristems and are specialized in their structure and function constitute permanent tissues. These cells do not generally divide further. • Permanent tissues that are made up of cells that are similar in structure and function are called simple tissues. • Permanent tissues made up of different types of cells are called complex tissues. Simple tissues • A tissue consisting only one type of cells. • They are parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma. 3 ","Parenchyma • Parenchyma is the most common tissue type. • The parenchyma consists of cells that are isodiametric. • They vary in shape depending on function. • They have thin walls made up of cellulose. • They usually are closely packed or may have small intercellular spaces. • Parenchyma cells are modified to perform various functions like photosynthesis, storage, secretion. Collenchyma • The collenchyma occurs in layer below the epidermis in dicotyledonous plants as hypodermis. • It is found either as a homogeneous layer or in patches. • It consists of cells which are much thickened at the corners due to a deposition of cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin. • Collenchyma cells vary in shape and often contain chloroplast. • In collenchyma cells containing chloroplasts food is assimilated. • Intercellular spaces are absent. • They provide mechanical support to the growing parts of the plant. They allow the part to bend without breaking. They are present in young parts such as young stem and petiole of a leaf (in dicot herb) Types of Collenchyma 4 ","• Majumdar divided collenchyma into three types :- 1. Lamellar / plate collenchyma: - The cells of collenchyma arranged in lamellar forms. The cell has thickening on the tangential walls. Due to such type of deposition, cell looks like a lamellar or plates. Ex. Raphanus • 2. Angular collenchyma: - This collenchyma is formed abundantly. The cells of this tissue is angular. The deposition of pectin at the angles of cell. e.g., Datura, Cucurbita • 3. Lacunar collenchyma: - Large intracellular spaces are present in between these cells. Deposition of pectin on the wall of intracellular spaces. Intra-cellular spaces of collenchyma thickened. Ex. Sunflower stem. III. SCLERENCHYMA Name coined by Mettenius – Main features:- • Sclerenchyma is the main mechanical tissue. • These cells are long, narrow, thick walled and dead. • Cell wall of their cells is thick and lignified. • Various types of pits are formed due to the deposition of lignin on hard wall. Type of Sclerenchyma Sclerenchyma cells are of two types - Sclereids & Sclerenchymatous fibers I. Sclereids - These cells are small extremely thick walled and their ends are pointed. Sclereids are isodiametric or irregular in shape, Sclereids cells have more pits and lumen is almost very small. Their pit cavity (lumen) is branched. Tsirch classified the sclereids on the basis of their shapes:- a. Stones cells or Brachysclereids or Grit cells:- These cells are spherical or oval in shape. They are found in endocarp of drupe fruits, so that endocarp becomes hard. Example - They are present in endocarp of coconut, mango, almond, walnut etc. Besides dry fruit brachysclereids also present in fleshy (edible) part of pear. Grittiness in pear fruit is due to this sclereids. b. Macro-sclereids or Rod cells or Malpighi cells:- They are small and rod like cells. They are present in seed coats. Example - They form part of seed coat in legume plants. Due to their presence seed coat becomes hard. Seed coats of lotus is hardest (stony). Seed coat of French bean is harder among the leguminous plants. They aid seed dormancy in leguminous seeds. c. Osteio-Sclereids:- These are known as prop-cells. These are pillar like cells. Both end of the cells spread to form a bony structure. Example - These cells are found in leaves of Hakea and Osmanthus . d. Astero Sclereids:- These cells are stellate shaped. They are found in floating leaves. Example - The leaves of Victoria , lotus etc. e. Trichoselereids:- These are also known as internal hairs. They are spine-like, bifurcated cells which is present in floating leaves. Example - Victoria, Nelumbo, Nymphea . 5 ","II. SCLERENCHYMATOUS FIBER On the basis of structure fibers classified into two parts:- a. Libriform fibers:- They are extremely thickened long fibers. They possess simple pits. Libriform fibers are present in Phloem, xylem, pericycle and hypodermis. They are present maximum in phloem. b. Fiber Tracheids:- They are highly thickened as compared to others. Bordered pits are present in these fibers. They are only found in xylem. On the basis of position fibers divided into three types - (i) Surface fibers - They are also called “Filling fibers ”. They are present on the surface of plant bodies. Example - Cotton fibers are formed by the outgrowth of seed coat. They are not any type of tissues. Cotton fibers composed of cellulose and not lignified. So that cotton fibers are not true fibers. Two types of fibers are found in cotton. Long fibers are called ‘lint’ and small fibers known as ‘fuzz’. Fuzz is filling fiber. Coir of coconut is also type of surface fibers. They are derived from the mesocarp. It is true fiber. (ii) Xylary or wood fibers: They are hard fibers. They are lack of flexibility. They cannot be knitted so that they are not useful. They are found in xylem. Ex. munj fiber (iii) Bast fibers: - They are also known as commercial fibers. They are flexible and can be knitted. These fibers are obtained from the phloem and pericycle of plants. The best fibers of Corchorus spp (Jute) and Crotalaria juncia (Sun hemp) are obtained from the phylum. The base fibers of hemp ( Cannabis sativa ) and Linum usitatissimum (flax) are obtained from pericycle. The bast fibers have great economic value. Complex Permanent Tissue A complex tissues are a collection of different type of cells. This is a heterogeneous group of cells. Complex tissue is absent in gametophytes. Complex tissues is of two types - a. Xylem b. Phloem 6 ","A. Xylem The term ‘Xylem’ was coined by Nageli. Xylem also provides mechanical support to the plant in addition to conducting water and minerals. On the basis of development xylem divided into primary xylem and secondary xylem. Primary xylem originates from procambium. Parenchyma of primary xylem does not differentiate and medullary rays are also absent. Secondary xylem originates through the secondary growth. The elements of xylem are (i) Tracheids, (ii) Vessels or tracheae xylem fibers. • Tracheids are elongated cells with tapering ends. • Tracheids having a large lumen as compared to the fibers. • Tracheids join together at their ends to form a long rows. These rows extend from the roots via stem to the leaves. • A transverse septum lies between any two tracheids. It bears pits. • Tracheids are dead and lignified cells. The deposition of lignin on cell wall is responsible for various thickenings. Lignification also forms various types of pits. Pits are the non-thickened areas. • Bordered pits are mainly present on the wall of tracheids. The maximum bordered pits are found in the tracheids of Gymnospermic plants. • Maximum deposition of lignin is in pitted thickening. • Different types of thickening of lignin are found in tracheids. • Spiral, annular and reticulate thickening of lignin is found in protoxylem. • Pitted thickening of lignin is found in metaxylem. 2. Vessels:- • Advance conductive element of xylem. • The basic structure of vessels is the same as tracheids. • They are also dead elements of xylem. • The lumen of vessels is wider than the tracheids. • Vessels are only found in xylem of angiosperms but some gymnosperms like Ephedra, Gnetales and Welwitschia also show the presence of vessels as an exception. • Similarly vessels are absent in some Angiospermic plants such as Dracaena, Yucca, Dazinaria, Drymeace, Vintera, Tetracentron and Trochodendron etc. • Transverse septum is absent between two cells. If present then it is porous. Thus vessels are more capable than tracheids. • Vessels usually contain simple pits. Thickening of wall is the same as tracheids. • Due to the absent of transverse septum, vessels work as a pipeline during conduction of water. 3. Xylem fibers:- • This is also dead part of xylem. • Xylem fibers provides strength to the tracheids and vessels. Mainly they provide strength to the vessels. • They are more abundant in secondary xylem. • The radial conduction of water is the function of xylem parenchyma. Water Conduction Elements of Xylem:- 7 ","• Tracheid and vessels are collectively known as water conducting elemen ts or “Hadrome”. Development of conducting elements by three types :- I. Centrifugal: - In this type of development, the protoxylem formed near the centre axis and metaxylem is formed away from the centre towards the periphery. This condition is known as endarch . Ex. stem of angiosperm &Gymnosperm. II. Centripetal: - In which protoxylem is formed away from the centre near the pericycle and metaxylem is formed towards the centre. This condition is called exarch . Ex. Roots. III. Centrifugal and centripetal: - In which elements of metaxylem is formed from both side of the elements of protoxylem. So that protoxylem is surrounded by metaxylem. This condition is known as mesarch ex. stem of fern. Components of Xylem Tissue Types of thickening is Tracheids 8 ","B. PHLOEM The term ‘Phloem’ was coined by Nageli. The main function of phloem is the transport of organic materials from one place to another place. On the basis of development, phloem is classified into two categories primary and secondary phloem. Primary phloem is derived from procambium and secondary phloem is derived from vascular cambium. Phloem remains active for lesser time compared to xylem. Phloem consist of 4 types of cells as below:- 1. Sieve cell:- • Sieve element was discovered by Harting. • Sieve element is living and has thin walled cells. • A matured sieve cell lacks nucleus. Thus these are non-nucleated living cells. • Central vacuole is present in each sieve cells. Cytoplasm of sieve cells streams in the form of thin layer around the vacuole (cyclosis). • In Angiosperms sieve cells are arranged end-to-end and form sieve tube. • Sieve plate (transverse perforated septa) is present between the two sieve cells. It is porous. Materials are transported only through these pores. • Callose is deposited on the radius of pores during dropping (falling) season of leaves to form a thick layer. This is called Callus pad. • Sieve plate protected by callus pad. It also prevents bacterial infection and protects against drought. • Callose dissolves during spring season. • In Gymnosperm and pteridophytes, sieve cells do not form sieve plates and are arranged irregularly. Sieve elements have sieve plates on their lateral walls. • Thus conduction of food is in zig-zag manner. • Sieve cells contain special type of protein-P-protein which is related with conduction of food and it repairs damaged sieve cells. 9 ","• Sieve cell and companion cell originate together. Both of them originate from a single cell sister cells. • The companion cells and sieve cells connect their cytoplasm through plasmodesmata. • Companion cells are only found in Angiosperms (exception -Austrobaileya ). • Companion cell is a living cell with a large nucleus. This nucleus also controls the cytoplasm of sieve cells. • Special type of cells are attached with the sieve cells in conifers. They are called albuminous cells . 3. Phloem fibers: - A fiber which are present in phloem is called Libriform fibers. These fibers provide support to the sieve cells. The main function of that fibers to provide mechanical support. They are used for making ropes, rough clothes and mats etc. 4. Phloem Parenchyma: - It is also called bast parenchyma . They are living and thin walled cells. They store various food materials. Phloem parenchyma is absent in monocotyledonous plants. The main function of phloem parenchyma is conduction of food in radial direction and storage of food. The vascular part of phloem sieve cells is called Leptom . Special tissue or secretory tissue I. Lactiferous tissue:- They are made up of long, highly branched and thin walled cells. These cells filled with milky juice, it is called Latex. Latex is known as plant milk. Latex obtained from the plants that is called petrocrops . • Latex is the mixture of saccharides, starch granules, alkaloids minerals and waste materials. Starch granules present in latex are dumbbell shaped. Latex provides protection to the plant. It also protects the plants from grazing animals. It prevents the infection of bacteria and fungus. Lactiferous tissue is of two types - Latex cells and latex vessels. i. Latex cells - They are non-articulated latex ducts/tubes. They are long branched and multinucleate cells. Such types of cells are called coenocytic cells . Example: - Latex cells are found in Calotropis, Euphorbia and Nerium . ii. Latex vessels: - They are articulated vessels. Latex vessels are formed due to dissolution of cell walls of meristematic cells. Thus they are syncytic cells. Latex vessels are also multinucleated. Example: - Latex vessels are present in Heavea , Banyan tree, Ficus , Papaver etc. Highly developed latex vessels are found in the fruit wall of Opium . • As the name indicates, this tissue is present in the form of glands. These glands contains secretory or excretory materials. Glandular tissues have two types of glands. • Glands are found in Urtica dioica (Bicchubutti) are unicellular, these cells are present on the surface of the leaves. They are spiny glands in which formic acid is filled. Multicellular glands are of two types. 1. External Glands: - They are located on the surface of the plants, or arising as an outgrowth from the epidermis. These glands are of various types:- i. Digestive glands: - Digestive glands are found in insectivorous plants. These insectivorous plant compensate their deficiency of Nitrogen. They are found in Utricularia, Drosera, and Dionia etc. plants. ii. Oil Glands : - These glands secrete volatile oil. These glands are present in the leaves of Eucalyptus and external fruit wall of Citrus (Lemon). iii. Nectar Glands: - These glands are embedded in the tissues. They are found in floral parts mainly in thalamus. These glands secrete nectar to attract the insects. 10 ","2. Internal Glands: - These glands are embedded in the tissues. Internal glands are of following types. i. Mucous secreting glands: - These glands secretes mucous. They are found in the leaves of betel. ii. Oil glands: - Oil glands are of both types external and internal. These secretes oil. It act as an antiseptic. These glands are found in lemon orange etc. fruits. iii. Tannin, resin, gum secretory glands are also internal glands. Maximum resin glands are present in palm. Gum glands are found in Acacia (Babool). Resin ducts are schizogenous. iv. Water gland:-Water glands are open on Hydathode. These glands are related to guttation. Hydathodes are present in Tomato, Pistia, and Ichornia Nasturtium etc. It is related with epitheme tissue. • Tracheids of pteridophytes have long or elongated bordered pits. Such type of pits are called scalar form pits. Tissue System On the basis of division of labour, tissues are categorised into three different system. Each system usually consists of an association of tissues which performs specific function. 1. The Epidermal tissue system: - This system includes epidermis and its related cells, hairs, pores, etc. 2. Ground tissue system: - It is the largest tissue system. It includes hypodermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle and medullary rays (pith rays). 3. Vascular tissue system: - This tissue system originates from the cambium. It consists of xylem and phloem. Types of vascular Bundles • On the basis of arrangement of different parts of vascular bundles are divided into three categories. I. Conjoint collateral vascular bundles -When the xylem and phloem are present on the same radius in vascular bundle. In this vascular bundle order of condition is found. This vascular bundle is found in gymnosperm and angiosperm. Open vascular bundle is found in dicotyledons and gymnosperm. Closed vascular bundle is found in monocots. II. Conjoint bicollateral vascular bundle - These are two patches of phloem one on each side of xylem. In such a vascular bundles there are two strips of cambium one on each side of xylem. Only found when vascular bundle is open. Such type of vascular bundle is known as bicollateral vascular bundle. Ex. stem of family Cucurbitaceae. III. Radial vascular Bundles:-When the xylem and phloem are present on different radii the vascular bundles are called radial vascular bundle. All the roots of plants contains radial vascular bundle. The development of xylem in these vascular bundle is centripetal. Thus, these vascular bundles are called exarch. IV. Concentric vascular bundles: - In this vascular bundle either xylem surrounds the phloem surrounds the xylem. Concentric vascular bundles are always closed. They are of two types - i. Amphicribal or Hadrocentric:-The xylem is in the centre and is surrounded on all sides by phloem. Such vascular bundle is termed amphicribal. The development of xylem in 11 ","these vascular bundles either centripetal or centrifugal manner. These are known as mesarch vascular bundle. Such types of vascular bundles are found in ferns and lower Gymnosperms. ii. Amphivasal or Leptocentric: - In this type of vascular bundle xylem completely surrounds the phloem. It means phloem is present in the centre of the vascular bundles. • Such type of vascular bundle is termed endarch. Such vascular bundle exceptionally formed in Angiosperms e.g. Dracaena, Yucca etc., • The stele is the whole central mass of vascular tissue with or without pith surrounded on the outer side by endodermis. Vantieghem and Douliot gave the hypothesis to explain stele. According to their hypothesis, stele is the central part or core of the plant which includes the vascular system and its relative structures. • The tissues which lies inside the stele is called intrastelar tissues and the tissues which lie outside the stele is known as extrastelar tissues. Stele is surrounded by endodermis. However endodermis is originally the part of cortex. 1. Protostele or Monostele:- Protostele is the most primitive and simplest type of stele. It consists of a solid mass of xylem completely surrounded by phloem. Such type of stele is devoid of pith. Solid stele is of following types:- i. Haplostele: - In this stele, xylem surrounded by a smooth layer (some thickness) of phloem. Central xylem is in cylindrical form. ii. Actino stele: - Actino stele is that in which the central xylem has radiating ribs and assume a star shaped appearance. Example - Psilotum & Isoetes. iii. Plecto Stele : - A such type of solid stele in which the xylem divides into a number of separate plates which lie parallel to one another. Example - Most of the species of Lycopodium . 2. Siphono stele - Siphono stele is that stele in which the pith is present in centre of hollow vascular cylinder. Siphono is of following two types - 12 ","i. Ectopholic siphonostele - In such type of vascular tissue of stele phloem is always present outside of the xylem. Example - Equicetum, Osmunda ii. Amphiphloic siphonostele – In the vascular tissue of such type of stele xylem is surrounded by phloem on the both sides Example -Adiantum, Marsilea 3. Soleno Stele :- Solenostele is that stele in which leaf gaps are produced in the main vascular tissue. Leaf gaps are produced by breaking of main vascular tissues due to the leaf. These broken pieces of stele are called soleno stele. Soleno stele also may be Ectophloic or Amphiphloic 4. Dictyo Stele - When the production of many leaf gaps in solenostele main vascular cylinder, breaks into many fragments, then such type of solenostele is called Dictyostele. Each divided fragment (piece) is called meristele. Each meristele has its own separate endodermis and pericycle. Dictyostele is well developed type of stele in Pteridophytes. Example - Pteridium, Pteris, Dryopteris 5. Eustele - In this type of stele, vascular bundle present in circle and medullary rays located in between them. Such type of stele is found in gymnosperm and dicotyledonous plants. 6. Atactostele - Many vascular bundles are distributed in the ground tissue. Such type of stele is called atactostele. This is highly developed type of stele. Endodermis and pericylce is absent in atacto stele. Such type of stele is the main characteristic feature of monocotyledons. 13 ","Dicot stem Primary structure of a typical dicot stem shows following features - 1. Epidermis - Epidermis is the outermost layer of the stem. It is made up of single layer of cells and lack of chloroplast. Multicellular hairs and stomata are found on epidermis. Epidermis play a significant role in protection. 2. Hypodermis - It is present just below the epidermis. It is provides additional support to the epidermis. It is thick multicellular layer. This layer is composed of collenchyma and their cells contain chloroplast. So the hypodermis is green and photosynthetic. 3. Cortex - This part is composed by parenchyma. Storage of food is the main function of the cortex. The innermost layer of the cortex is termed endodermis. 4. Endodermis - This is thick single layer of cells. The cells of endodermis are barrel shaped. These cells accumulate starch in dicot stem. Therefore it is also called as “starch sheath”. 5. Pericycle - This layer is situated in between the endodermis and vascular bundles (below the epidermis and above the vascular bundle). The pericycle of stem is multi-layered and made up of scerenchyma. Pericyle is also known as Hard bast. In stem of sunflower, pericycle is made of alternate bands of parenchymatous and sclerenchymatous cells. The cells of pericycle in front of the vascular bundle is made up of sclerenchyma and remaining is composed by parenchyma. A pericycle situated in front of vascular bundle is known as Bundle cap. 6. Vascular Bundle - The vascular bundle of dicot stem arranged in a ring. Well-developed pith is present below the ring. Each vascular bundle is conjoint collateral endarch , and open . Each vascular bundle is made of phloem and xylem. Eustele is present in dicot stems. Monocot Stem The following structure is seen in a typical monocotyledon stem - 1 . Epidermis - Epidermis is the outermost one called thick layer. It is covered with thick cuticle lined with stomata. Multicellular hairs are absent. The number of stomata is also less comparatively. 2 . Hypodermis - Hypodermis of monocotyledon stem is made up of sclerenchyma. This are made of 2-3 layer of sclerenchyma. 3 . Ground tissues - The entire mass of parenchyma cells next to hypodermis and extending to the centre is called ground tissue. These is no differentiation into endodermis, cortex, pericycle etc. 4. Vascular Bundle - Many vascular bundles are scattered in the ground tissue. Vascular bundles that lie toward the centre are larger and lesser in number. Vascular bundles situated towards the periphery are smaller but greater in number. Each vascular bundle is conjoint collateral endarch and closed type. Vascular bundles surrounded by the layer of sclerenchyma is known as bundle sheath. Monocotyledon stem contain only xylem and phloem. i. Xylem - Xylem element of monocotyledon are arranged like a ‘Y’ and it has limited no. of vascular elements. Two small vessels are positioned radially toward axis in the form of protoxylem. Due to presence of water in this cavity, it is also called water cavity. This cavity is formed by disintegration of the element present below the protoxylem and neighbouring parenchyma. 5 . Pith and stele - Atactostele is found in monocotyledon .This is highly developed stele. 14 ","DICOT ROOT 1 . Epidermis - It is a uniseriate outermost layer. Unicellular root hairs arising from the some cells of epidermis of root is known as epiblema or Rhizodermis or Piliferous layer. 2. Cortex - This part is made up of parenchymatous cells. The cells of outer part of cortex are suberized in old root. It is called Exodermis. 3. Endodermis - This layer is situated between the vascular tissues and cortex. Casparian strips present radially in innermost layer of endodermis. These strips are made up of suberin. 4. Pericycle - This is a single called thick layer. It is composed by a type of parenchyma, which is called prosenchyma. Pericycle of roots is single layered. Cork cambium is formed from this layer during the secondary growth. Lateral root originates from the pericycle. Thus lateral roots are endogenous in origin. The branches of stem are exogenous in origin, because they originate from the outer part of cortex. 5. Vascular bundles - Vascular bundles are radial and exarch, xylem and phloem are separate and equal in number. The number of vascular bundle in dicot is two to six (diarch to hexarch). But in Ficus (Banyan tree) polyarchic condition is found as an exception. Tissues are situated between the xylem and phloem are called conjugative tissue. These are consist of parenchyma. Vascular cambium is formed from the conjugative tissue during the secondary growth. Thus all cambium is formed after the secondary growth in roots. 6. Pith - It is found in the centre and is less developed or absent. Flexibility occurs due to this. Monocot Root & Leaf of Structure The internal structure of a typical monocot root is the same as dicot root. But number of vascular bundle is more than six in monocot root. But exceptionally the number of vascular bundle in onion is two to six. In monocot root pith is well developed. 15 ","Internal structure of leaf - Generally leaves are divided into two categories -Dorsiventral leaves and isobilateral leaves. The difference in between them are as follows - 1. Dorsiventral leaves are attached at right angles to the stem while isobilateral leaves attached parallel to the stem. 2. The structure of both the surface of dorsiventral leaves is different, while in isobilateral, structure of both surface is similar. 3. Dorsiventral leaves found in dicot but exceptionally, isobilateral leaves also formed in Eucalyptus . 4. Isobilateral leaves occurs in monocotyledon, but Lilium longiflora is the exception of this. Secondary Growth “The growth in diameter (girth) of the plant organs, is called secondary growth”. A permanent internal structure of the organs is formed through the apical meristems. This structure is formed in the beginning of some weeks of the first year. This structure is known as primary structure. Primary structure is only found in Pteridophytes and monocotyledon plants. A normal secondary growth is found in roots and stem of dicotyledons and Gymnosperms. Due to lack of vascular cambium in monocotyledons, secondary growth is absent. But exceptionally secondary growth is found in some monocotyledons. Such as Palm, yucca, Draccaena, Smilax, Agave, Coconut etc. Secondary growth in Dicot Stem 16 ","A. Secondary growth in vascular Region - Secondary growth in vascular region begins (starts) earlier than the cortical region. It is complete in the following steps - I. Formation of ring of vascular cambium - A cambium present in vascular bundle is called intrafascicular cambium. This is a type of primary meristem. First of all, cells of medullary rays becomes meristematic and forming interfascicular cambium. Intrafascicular and interfascicular cambium are collectively known as vascular cambium. Vascular cambium is formed in the form of a complete ring which is made by single layer of the cells. Two types of cells are found in the ring of this vascular cambium. Fusiform initials and ray initials. Fusiform initials are long with pointed ends, while ray initials are spherical (oval). More fusiform initials are present in vascular cambium. II. Activity of vascular cambium- A continuous periclinal division or tangential division takes place in fusiform initials. The plane of division in periclinal divisions is parallel to longitudinal axis of a cell. Few cells are formed towards the radius (periphery) through this type of activity and these cells differentiates into secondary phloem or bast. Some of the cells are formed towards the central axis and these cells are differentiate into secondary xylem or wood. Normally more secondary xylem is formed as compared to secondary phloem. By the pressure of secondary phloem primary phloem is pushed towards the outside and gets crushed. Thus epidermis and hypodermis cannot be seen during the secondary growth in stem. By the pressure of secondary phloem primary pushed toward the outside gets crushed. Thus epidermis and hypodermis cannot be seen during the secondary growth in stem. By the pressure of secondary xylem, all the primary tissues - such as primary xylem, pith, old secondary xylem etc. degenerated in the centre of stem because woody. I. Ring porous wood - Vessels are arranged in the form of a ring in this wood. Such wood conducts water more efficiently. II. Diffused porous wood – Asystematical distribution of vessels is found in this type of wood. Formation of Annual Rings The activity of cambium does not remains equal but it is changeable in the whole year. In winter or autumn season the activity of the cambium is poor and the secondary xylem or wood formed is not extensive through the vascular cambium. Cells formed during this period, are small thick walled and have narrow lumen. This is called autumn wood or late wood. The vascular cambium is highly active in spring or summer season and secondary xylem formed during this period is extensive and cells of secondary xylem are larger, thin walled and have wider lumen. This wood is known as spring wood or early wood. The autumn and spring wood is formed in rings. The ring of any type of wood is called growth ring. Thus two growth rings are formed during a year. A ring of autumn wood and a ring of spring wood collectively known as Annual ring. Thus an annual ring consist of two growth ring. The number of annual rings formed in a tree come give the idea of the age of the tree. The study of determination of age of the plant by this techniques is called Dendrochronology. The annual rings are counted form the base of the stem. This is because basal part has maximum annual rings and upper part has less. Therefore, counting form the basal region can give the correct idea. A piece is taken from the stem up to central region with the help increment borer instrument. The annual ring is counted from that piece and again inserted (fitted) into the same stem at the same place. Annual ring is formed more distinct in changeable seasons. 17 ","A more distinct annual ring is formed in temperate plants. A distinct annual ring is not formed in tropical plants. A clear annual ring is not formed in India except Himalayan regions. Lesser distinct annual ring is formed in seashore regions because their climate remains the same the whole year. Clearer annual ring is formed in deciduous plants as compared to evergreen plants. Periclinical division also goes on continuously in ray initials of vascular cambium. Some of the cells are formed on the inner side and some of the cells are formed on the outer side through these divisions. All these cells are made up of parenchyma. Radial lines of cells of parenchyma are formed in the stem. They are called Vascular rays. Medullary rays are primary and vascular rays are secondary. Both of them conduct water and food in radial direction. B. Secondary growth in Cortical Region As a result of the addition of the secondary vascular tissues, increasing the diameter of circle of xylem region and cortical region, comes under stress and strain. Therefore some cortical tissues ultimately get ruptured. To make good this loss, protective tissues of epidermis tries to compensate but they are fail and get ruptured at many places. This loss in fulfilled by the activity of cork cambium. Cork cambium is also known as Phellogen or Extrastelar cambium. Cork cambium arises from the hypodermis or from the outer layer of cortex because they become meristematic. Those cells formed towards the inside differentiate into parenchyma. These are called secondary cortex or Phelloderm. Phellogen, cork and phelloderm are collectively known as periderm. Phellogen + Phellem (cork) + Phelloderm = Periderm Cork is produced in high quantity and secondary cortex is made in less quantity from the cork cambium. The highest activity of cork cambium is in winter season. Most of the cells of phellem are dead. But in some places living cells are also found. Suberin is not deposited in these places. These places are known as Lenticels. Lenticels appears on the outer surface of the plant either in small points or in the form of areas of protuberance. Lenticels are made up of scattered collection of living cells. These cells are known as complementary tissue. Lenticels are normally formed below the stomata. Lenticels serve for exchange of gases between the plant and atmosphere. Transpiration also takes place through the lenticels. It is known as lenticular transpiration. Adventitious roots cutting originate from the living cells of lenticels in vegetative reproduction. Lenticels are mainly formed on stem and are never found on leaves. Even lenticels are present all over the plant body. They are also present on fruits. Cork cambium remains living only for the one year. Each year, a new cambium is formed below the previous cambium. This new cambium is derived from the secondary cortex on phelloderm. Bark All the tissue situated outside the vascular cambium is called Bark. Bark has two parts. 1. Outer Bark - Outer bark is dead. All the tissues that lie outside the cork cambium are called outer bark. It is also known as Rhytidome. 2. Inner Bark - The region in between the cork cambium and vascular cambium is called inner bark. Most of this part is living. The main region of inner bark is the secondary phloem or bast. 18 ","Thus bark consists of both type of tissues: living and non-living (dead). A plant will die if we remove the complete bark of the plant because maximum loss of water occurs due to this. If a ring of bark is removed from the base of the plant, within a few days a plant dies. This happens because phloem is separated due to this activity and plant comes in the state of deficiency of food. Kind of Bark 1. Ring Bark - Ring bark is formed around the stem in a complete ring. When the ring of cork cambium is complete then it is known as ring bark. Example - Betula vulgaris - Bhojpatra, A complete distinct ring bark is formed in this plant. Its bark was used as writing material as a paper in the ancient period. Ring bark is also formed in Eucalyptus. 2. Scaly Bark - This bark is formed around the stem in the form of pieces or fragments. When the ring of cork cambium is not continuous, the scaly bark is formed. Secondary growth in Dicot Root - Secondary growth is essential in roots. This is important to provide strength to the growing aerial parts of the plants and fulfill the requirement of water and minerals. Secondary growth is not found in monocot roots. First of all, conjunctive tissue becomes meristematic during the secondary growth in a dicot-root to form a vascular cambium which is formed in separate curved strips. Then after, the cells of pericycle lying outside the protoxylem also becomes meristematic. This forms additional strips of cambium. In this way a complete ring of vascular cambium is formed. The portion of vascular cambium is formed by pericycle is less. The main portion of vascular cambium is formed by conjunctive tissue. The shape of ring of vascular cambium is wavy in the beginning, but later on it becomes circular due to the pressure of secondary xylem. The portion of vascular cambium formed by conjunctive tissue becomes meristematic first and forms the secondary xylem towards the centre. Ultimately the ring becomes circular by the pressure of secondary xylem (Pushing outwards). The activity of vascular cambium of root is the same as the activity of vascular cambium of stem. Secondary xylem is formed towards the inner side and secondary phloem is formed toward the outer side by vascular cambium. The portion of vascular cambium which is formed by pericycle is responsible for the formation of pith rays. These are made by parenchyma. These pith rays are known as primary medullary rays. A few medullary or pith rays are also formed from vascular cambium. These are called secondary medullary rays. Thus two types of medullary rays are found in the secondary structure of roots. The presence of two types of medullary rays is basic characteristic features of roots. Only secondary rays are found in stem. Both of the medullary rays conduct water and food in radial direction. Cork cambium is developed from the pericycle in roots. Cork is formed towards the outside and secondary cortex is formed towards the inner side by the cork cambium. Functions of secondary meristem (Cambium) 1. Healing of wounds -When wound is formed on any stem, then living cells of the wound are responsible to form a cambium. This is called wound cambium. It is also called inducible cambium. This newly formed cambium forms a cork towards the outside. The cork covers the wound entirely. Thus the wound is healed. An outgrowth like structure of parenchymatous cells are found on the margins of the wound. This is known as Callus. 2. Abscission - The leaves of most of the Pteridophytes and branched angiosperms either fall after degeneration or when destroyed on the plants. 19 ","The leaves in gymnosperms and woody dicotyledons are separate through the abscission before their death. Middle lamella dissolves in abscission layer. Abscission and primary walls also dissolve partially or completely. The place from where leaf gets separated, is called leaf scar. The living cells present in leaf scar are responsible to form cork cambium. As a result cork is formed towards the outside. So ultimately the leaf gets detached from the plant. This is termed abscission. Anomalous secondary growth in stem- 1. Anomalous/abnormal position of vascular cambium- Normally vascular cambium is circular, but is folded in stem of some plants. Later on these folds break and separate from each other. Each fold is responsible to form a complete vascular bundle. Many vascular bundles are formed in stem. Example - Thinowia, Serjania, Bauhinia . 2. Abnormal Activity of vascular Cambium - Parenchyma is formed form the maximum part of the vascular cambium. Only (rarely) in some places xylem and phloem is formed, while generally xylem and phloem is formed from the maximum part of the vascular cambium, and medullary rays are formed from the few part of vascular cambium. Example - Aristolochia, Vitis vinifera (Grape). 3. Sequential or successive ring of vascular cambium- In some of the plants, a new ring of vascular cambium is formed in each year. This is formed outside the previous ring. Example - Cycas, Gnetum, Mirabilis, Boerahvia, Bougainvilia , etc. 4. External Stelar vascular cambium - Vascular cambium is formed from the pericycle in plants of Amaranthaceae and Chinopodiaceae family. A complete ring of vascular cambium is formed from the pericycle. 5. Interxylary Cork - Parenchyma of secondary xylem becomes meristematic in some of the plants and behave like a cork cambium. It means cork is formed to the interior of wood. Example - Artemesiatridentata etc. 6. Cork cambium from Epidermis - Cork cambium originates from the epidermis in same of the plants. Example – Solanum dulcamara, Quercus suber (oak). Commercial cork is obtained from the oak. 7. Secondary Growth in Monocotyledons - In some members of plants such as Dracaena, Yucca, Lomandra, Kingia, Senseviera, Agave, Aloe arboresence, Vascular cambium formed from the outer region of the ground tissues. Parenchyma is formed towards the outside by the vascular cambium and vascular bundles are formed toward the inner side. In some plants, the girth of the stem increases without cambium. Such as Palms, Musa, Tulips etc. The apical meristem of these plants is special type. This is known as primary thickening meristem. This apical meristem is responsible for the growth in both length and girth (thickness) of the plant. 20 ","Chapter 7 Structural Organisation in Animals • Cells of multicellular organisms are organised into tissues to carry out various functions. • Tissue: A group of similar cells along with intercellular substances that perform a specific function • All complex animals consist of only four basic tissue types. • Organ: A group of similar and dissimilar tissues in a living organism that have been organized and adapted to perform a common specific function like heart, lung, kidney, stomach, etc. • Organ System: A group of different organs that work together to perform a common function.

These glands secrete saliva, mucus, earwax, oil, milk, digestive enzymes, and other cell products. ➢ Endocrine: They do not have any ducts (ductless glands). Their products are called hormones and are directly secreted into the fluid bathing the gland. • Stratified or Compound Epithelium: ➢ They are made of more than one layer of cells, I,e., they are multi-layered. ➢ They have limited role in secretion and absorption. ➢ They mainly function in providing protection against mechanical and chemical stresses. ➢ They are present on the dry surface of the skin, pharynx, the moist surface of the buccal cavity, inner lining of ducts of salivary glands and ducts of pancreas. • Junctions: They are specialised structures that provide structural and functional links between individual cells. • They are tight, adhering and gap junctions. • Tight junctions: The specialised structures that prevents substance leak across a tissue • Adhering junctions: The specialised structure that cements the neighbouring cells together. • Gap Junctions: The specialised structures that help cells to communicate with each other. They connect the cytoplasm of adjoining cells and thus help in rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and big molecules. 2 ","7.1.2: Connective Tissue: • The most abundant of all tissues in the body of complex animals are the different forms of connective tissue. They are also the most widely distributed. • They are so called because they function specially in the linking and supporting of tissues/organs of the body. • They are of different types, from soft to specialised. • Connective tissue comprises of widely spaced cells embedded in a matrix. • The nature of the matrix determines the function of the tissue. • In all connective tissues except blood, the cells secrete fibres of structural proteins called collagen or elastin. • The proteins provide strength, elasticity and flexibility to the tissue. 3 ","• The matrix or ground substance is formed by the accumulation of modified polysaccharides secreted by the cells. • Three major types of connective tissue: Loose connective tissue, dense connective tissue and specialised connective tissue. • Connective tissue can also be classified as: Connective tissue proper, skeletal tissue and vascular or fluid tissue . Loose Connective Tissue: • Cells and fibres are loosely arranged in a semi-fluid ground substance. • They are the areolar, adipose and reticular tissue . • Areolar Tissue: ➢ It is the most widely distributed connective tissue in the body. ➢ This tissue fills spaces inside organs. ➢ It is also found between skin and organs, around blood vessels, nerves and in bone marrow. ➢ It often serves as a support framework for epithelium. 4 ","➢ It contains fibroblasts, macrophages and mast cells. ➢ Fibroblasts produce and secrete two types of fibres: inelastic white fibres and elastic yellow fibres. ➢ It holds various tissues together in an organ. ➢ It helps to repair body tissues after injury. ➢ The mast cells are concerned with allergy. • Adipose Tissue: ➢ This tissue is located mainly beneath the skin. ➢ The cells are specialised to store fats. ➢ It consists of oval and round cells that are filled with fat globules, called as adipocytes. ➢ It provides insulation by preventing loss of heat from the body. ➢ It helps in the storage of excess energy in the form of fats. ➢ It forms a cushion-like shock absorber around the vital organs like heart, kidney, eye-balls, etc. • Reticular Tissue: ➢ Cells in this tissue are star-shaped and form a network like structure. ➢ The fibres are made up of reticulin protein. ➢ It is present in the spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, etc. ➢ It forms the lymphoid tissues in the body. ➢ Reticular tissue in the bone marrow helps in the formation of blood cells. Dense Connective Tissue: 5 ","• Cells, fibres and fibroblasts are arranged compactly with very little matrix. • Orientation of tissues may show regular or irregular pattern and are therefore called dense regular and dense irregular tissues respectively. • Dense regular connective tissues: Many parallel bundles of fibres are contain the collagen fibres in between. Collagen fibres are present as rows. Examples: tendons and ligaments. • Tendons: It is made up of white fibrous tissues. The fibroblasts are arranged almost continuously. It is tough and inelastic. It connects a skeletal muscle to bone. • Ligaments: It is made up of yellow elastic tissue. The fibroblasts are scattered. It is a strong and yet elastic tissue. It connects a bone to another bone. • Dense irregular connective tissues: In this the fibroblasts and fibres (mainly collagen) are oriented differently. These form the tissues present in the skin. 6 ","Specialised Connective Tissue: • Connective tissue that is specialised for specific function is called specialised connective tissue. • It includes bone, cartilage and lymph . • Bone: ➢ It is a type of skeletal tissue. ➢ It forms the supportive framework of the body. ➢ It consists of a hard non-pliable matrix composed of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and a protein (ossein) along with collagen. ➢ The matrix consists of longitudinal canals called Haversian canals. ➢ The matrix is present in the form of layers called lamellae. The lamellae are present as crescentic rings around Haversian canals. ➢ Within the lamellae ring shaped, fluid-filled spaces are present called as lacunae. ➢ The bone cells or the osteocytes are present in the lacunae. ➢ Bones support and protect softer tissues and organs. ➢ Limb bones, such as the long bones of the legs, serve weight-bearing functions. They also interact with skeletal muscles attached to them to bring about movements. ➢ The bone marrow in some bones is the site of production of blood cells. • Cartilage: ➢ It is also a type of skeletal tissue. ➢ This tissue is elastic and strong but softer than bone. ➢ The matrix is solid and pliable and resists compression. ➢ Cartilage cells or chondrocytes are enclosed in small cavities within the matrix secreted by them. ➢ The elasticity is due to the presence of protein chondrin. ➢ Cells are widely spaced and the matrix is reinforced by fibres. ➢ It forms the embryonic skeleton of vertebrates. Most of the cartilage is later replaced by bones. ➢ Cartilage is seen in certain regions like the tip of nose, limbs and hands in adults, outer ear joints, etc. It is also found in the vertebral column between adjacent bones. ➢ Cartilage forms the adult skeleton in sharks and rays. 7 ","• Blood: ➢ It is a fluid connective tissue composed of plasma and the blood cells. ➢ It is the main circulating fluid that helps in the transport of various substances. ➢ It is the softest connective tissue. ➢ Plasma is the fluid component consisting nearly 90% water. The remaining 10% is made up of proteins, salts, hormones and other materials meant for transport of digested food, gases, excretory products, etc. ➢ The blood cells include red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets. 7.1.3: Muscle Tissue: • Muscular tissue has the unique ability to contract and relax and thereby perform mechanical work. • Each muscle is made of many long cylindrical fibres arranged in parallel arrays. • The fibres are composed of numerous fine fibrils called myofibrils. • Muscle fibres contract when stimulated. They then relax and return in a co-ordinated fashion to their original uncontracted state. • Their action causes the body or parts of body to move in order to adjust to the changes in the environment and to maintain the positions of the various parts of the body. • Muscle cells are of three types: skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles . • Skeletal Muscle: ➢ It is closely attached to skeletal bones. ➢ They are striated and are bundled together in a parallel fashion. ➢ A sheath of tough connective tissue encloses several bundles of muscle fibres. ➢ They are also called as voluntary muscles as they are under the conscious control. ➢ Cells are multinucleate and unbranched. • Smooth Muscle: ➢ The cells taper at both ends to form a spindle or fusiform shape. ➢ They are non-striated. ➢ They are held together by cell junctions and bundled together in a connective tissue sheath. ➢ Cells are uninucleate. ➢ They are also called as involuntary muscles as their function is not under conscious control. ➢ They are found in the walls of internal organs such as stomach, intestine and blood vessels. 8 ","• Cardiac Muscle: ➢ It is a contractile muscle tissue present only in the heart. ➢ Cell junctions fuse plasma membranes of the cardiac muscle cells and make them stick together. ➢ Communication junctions or intercalated discs at some fusion points allow cells to contract as a unit. This means that when one cell receives the signal, its neighbouring cells are also stimulated to contract. ➢ They are involuntary muscles. ➢ They are uninucleate and branched. ➢ In these muscles rhythmic contraction and relaxation occurs throughout the life. 7.1.4: Neural Tissue • Neural tissue is specialised for conduction of nerve impulses. • It consists of densely packed cells called as the neurons . • Neurons are resent in the brain, spinal cord and the nerves. • Neuroglial cells protect and support the neurons. • Neuroglia make up more than one-half of the volume of neural tissue in our body. • The neuron consists of three parts- cyton, dendrites and axon. • Cyton: It is the cell body that contains a central nucleus and cytoplasm with characteristic deeply stained particles called as Nissl’s granules. • Dendrites: One to many short and branched cytoplasmic processes. They receive impulse from the receptor or another neuron and bring it to cyton. • Axon: Single long process that conducts impulse away from cyton to another neuron. • Nerve fibres may or may not be myelinated. • When a neuron is stimulated an electrical impulse is generated which travels quickly along the plasma membrane. When this impulse reaches at the ends of the neuron, it triggers events that cause stimulation or inhibition of adjacent neurons. 9 ","7.2: Organ and Organ System • The basic tissues types in the body organise in various manners to form organs. A group of such organs then associate with each other to form organ systems in the multicellular organisms. • Organisation of the body into tissues, organs and organ systems is essential for more efficient functioning of the body. It also helps in better coordination of the activities of millions of cells constituting an organism. • Each organ in our body is made of one or more type of tissues. For example, our heart consists of all the four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective, muscular and neural. • The complexity in organ and organ systems displays certain discernible trend and is called as evolutionary trend. 7.3: Earthworm • It is a terrestrial invertebrate that is reddish brown in colour and lives in the upper layer of moist sand. • They can be located by their faecal deposits called as worm casting. • The common Indian earthworms are Pheretima and Lumbricus. 7.3.1: Morphology: • Earthworms have a long cylindrical body. The body is divided into more than hundred short segments called as metamers which are similar (metameres about 100-120 in number). • The dorsal blood vessel is represented by a dark median mid-dorsal line present on the dorsal surface of the body. • The ventral surface is characterised by the presence of genital openings (pores). • Anterior end includes the mouth and the prostomium . Prostomium is a lobe which serves as a covering for the mouth. It is used as a wedge to force open cracks in the soil into which the earthworm may crawl. • The prostomium is sensory in function. • The first segment of the body contains the mouth and is called peristomium (buccal cavity). • A prominent dark band of glandular tissue called clitellum covers the segments 14-16 in a mature worm. • The body is divided into three segments: preclitellar, clitellar and postclitellar segments. 10 ","• On the ventro-lateral sides of the intersegmental grooves four pairs of spermathecal apertures are present. i.e., they are present between the 5 th -9th segments. • The mid-ventral line of 14th segment contains a single female genital pore . • On the ventro-lateral sides of the 18 th segment a pair of male genital pores are present. • Many tiny and minute pores called nephridiopores open on the surface of the body. • Nephridiopores: A nephridiopore is part of the nephridium, an excretory organ found in many organisms, such as flatworms and annelids. • Rows of S-shaped setae are present in each body segment. Setae are absent in the first, last and clitellum segments of the body. They are present embedded in the epidermal pits in the middle of each segment. Setae can be extended or retracted. Their principal role is in locomotion. 7.3.2: Anatomy • The body wall of the earthworm is covered externally by a thin non-cellular cuticle below which is the epidermis, two muscle layers (circular and longitudinal) and an innermost coelomic epithelium. • The epidermis is made up of a single layer of columnar epithelium which contains secretory glandular cells . • Digestive System: ➢ The alimentary canal is a straight tube and runs between first to last segment of the body. ➢ A mouth present at the end opens into the buccal cavity (1-3 segments). This then leads into muscular pharynx. A small oesophagus is present between 5 th -7 th segments. It continues into a muscular gizzard (8-9 segments). It aids the grinding of the soil particles and decaying of leaves, etc. ➢ The stomach is present between 9-14 segments. The earthworm feeds on decaying leaves and organic matter mixed with soil. Calciferous glands are present in the stomach. They neutralise the humic acid present in humus. ➢ Intestine begins at the 15th segment and ends at the last segment. A pair of short and conical intestinal caecae project from the intestine on the 26th segment. ➢ The characteristic feature of the intestine after 26th segment (except the last 23rd-25th segments) is the presence of internal median fold of dorsal wall called typhlosole . This increases the effective area of absorption in the intestine. ➢ The alimentary canal opens to the exterior by a small rounded aperture called anus. 11 ","➢ The ingested soil is rich in organic matter. It passes through the digestive tract. In the digestive tract digestive enzymes breakdown complex food into smaller absorbable units. These simpler molecules are absorbed through intestinal membranes and are utilised. • Circulatory System: ➢ Pheretima exhibits a closed type of blood vascular system , consisting of blood vessels, capillaries and heart. ➢ It shows closed circulatory system and therefore blood is confined to the heart and blood vessels. ➢ Contractions keep blood circulating in one direction. ➢ Smaller blood vessels supply the gut, nerve cord, and the body wall. ➢ Blood glands are present on the 4th, 5th and 6th segments . They produce the cells of the blood and haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is dissolved in blood plasma. ➢ Blood cells are phagocytic in nature. • Earthworms lack specialised breathing devices.

The ovarian funnels open into oviduct. They later join together and open on the ventral side to form single median female genital pore that is present on the 14th segment. ➢ During mating there is a mutual exchange of sperm between two worms. ➢ One worm finds another worm. Mating occurs when the worms juxtapose their gonadal openings opposite to each other. These gonadal openings are called spermatophores . They are used to exchange packets of sperms. ➢ The glands of clitellum produce cocoons. Into these cocoons mature sperm and egg cells are deposited along with the nutritive fluid. ➢ Fertilisation and development of ova takes place inside the cocoons. These cocoons are then released into the soil. The fertilized ova then falls off along with the cocoon from the worm. The worm embryos develop inside the cocoon. ➢ After approximately 3 weeks, each cocoon produces two to twenty baby worms. Four are produced on an average. ➢ Earthworm shows direct development of earthworms and there is no formation of larva. • Earthworms are also called as ‘friends of farmers’ . This is because they make burrows in the soil which makes it porous. This helps the developing plant roots to penetrate and respire. • Earthworms are used for vermicomposting .

This includes hepatocytes in liver, nephrons in kidney, neurons in brain, etc. Different cells are grouped together to form tissues which perform specific function. Fig.1. Different types of cells Cell theory In 1839, Schleiden, German botanist, and Schwann, a British zoologist, developed the cell theory or cell doctrine. The modern theory includes the following components-• All living organisms are made up of cells. • Cell is the structural and functional unit of life. • All cells arise from the pre-existing cells. This was given by Rudolf Virchow. • Energy flow occurs within the cells. • Cells contains the heredity information which is passed from cell to cell. • All cells have same chemical composition. 1 ","Structure of eukaryotic cells Plasma membrane Plasma membrane is a dynamic, fluid structure that forms the external boundary of the cell. It is a selectively permeable in nature. It allows only certain solutes to pass through it. In 1972, Jonathan Singer and Garth Nicolson proposed structure of the plasma membrane with the help of fluid mosaic model. According to this model, membrane is viewed as quasi-fluid structure in which proteins are embedded throughout the lipid bilayer. The bilayer is composed of two leaflets of amphipathic molecules with polar head and non-polar tails. Fig. 2. Structure of the plasma membrane The primary forces for organizing lipid bilayer are hydrophobic interactions. Three classes of lipids that are present in plasma membrane are phospholipids, glycolipids, and sterol. Membrane also contains two types of protein- peripheral proteins and integral proteins. Proteins which are held with the bilayer loosely and can be easily removed is known as peripheral proteins. Proteins that are held in the lipid bilayer very tightly and cannot be released easily is known as integral proteins. Cell Wall: A rigid non-living structure surrounding the plasma membrane is found in plant and fungal cells. It is called as cell wall. It provides shape to the cell. It also protects the cell against mechanical damage and infection. It prevents 2 ","the entry of unwanted macromolecules. Cell wall is essential for cell-to-cell transport and interaction. It consists of primary wall, middle lamella and secondary wall. Plasmodesmata which are connections between cytoplasm of neighboring cells are present in the middle lamella. Ribosomes Ribosomes are composed of RNAs and proteins. It translates genetic information stored in messenger RNA into proteins. Functional ribosomes consist of two subunits of unequal size, known as large and small subunits. Eukaryotes usually contain two types of ribosomes: cytosolic and organellar. The ribosome found in prokaryotes is 70S and in eukaryotes it is 80S. S stands for sedimentation coefficient. It is the ratio of a velocity to the centrifugal acceleration. Fig. 3. Structure of the ribosomes Endoplasmic reticulum It is the largest single membrane bound intracellular compartment. It is an extensive network of closed and flattened membrane bound structure. The enclosed compartment is called lumen. ER can be rough or smooth based on the presence or absence of ribosomes. When ribosomes are attached to ER, it is known as rough ER. When ER membrane do not contain any ribosomes, it is known as smooth ER. 3 ","Fig. 4. Structure of endoplasmic reticulum Proteins synthesized by ribosomes associated with the membrane of RER enter into the lumen and membrane of RER by the process of co-translational translocation. In the lumen of the RER, five principal modifications of proteins occur before they reach their final destination-addition and processing of carbohydrates, formation of disulfide bonds, proper folding, specific proteolytic cleavages and assembly into multimeric proteins. The SER have different functions such it acts as site for the lipid biosynthesis, detoxification and calcium regulation. Golgi complex/Golgi apparatus It is a single membrane bound organelle and forms a part of endomembrane system. It consists of flattened membrane sacs known as cisternae. Each stack is known as Golgi stack. Each Golgi stack has two faces- the cis face or the entry face and the trans face or exit face. The Golgi apparatus is especially prominent in cells that are specialized for secretion. 4 ","Fig. 5. Structure of Golgi apparatus Lysosomes It is a single membrane enclosed organelle which contains hydrolytic enzymes. Hydrolytic enzymes include proteases, nucleases, glycosidases, lipases, phospholipases, phosphatase and sulphatases. The environment is acidic inside the lysosomes with a pH of about 5.0. There is a proton pump inside the lysosomal membrane which pumps proton inside the membrane using ATP as a source of energy. Lysosomes are responsible for the digestion of both intracellular as well as extracellular materials. Fig. 6. Structure of lysosomes Vacuoles Fluid filled vesicles are known as vacuoles. A membrane known as tonoplast surrounds the vacuole. The pH of the lumen is similar to that of lysosomes and is therefore acidic. Vacuoles in plant cells contain water, dissolved inorganic ions, sugars, enzymes etc. This vacuole is different from another type of vacuole called contractile vacuole. Contractile vacuole is an organelle that functions in osmoregulation. It pumps excess of water out of the cell. For example, it is found in Amoeba . 5 ","Fig. 7. Structure of vacuoles Mitochondria It is found in all eukaryotic cell. It is a site for aerobic respiration. They are known as the power house of the cell as it synthesizes ATP, energy currency of the cell. They are the double membrane bound cell organelle. It contains circular DNA molecule and ribosomes. The space between the outer and the inner membrane is known as intermembrane space. The inner membrane is convoluted to form cristae. The inner membrane is impermeable to solutes and they are rich in phospholipid known as cardiolipin. Inner membrane contains enzyme complex known as ATP synthase or F 0 -F 1 ATPase. 6 ","Fig. 8. Structure of mitochondria Plastids They are double membrane cell organelle found in plant cells. They also contain double stranded DNA and ribosomes. They are differentiated into- leucoplast, chromoplast and chloroplast. Chloroplast encloses the fluid filled structure known as stroma. Stroma contains a stack of sacs called as granum. Each of the flattened sacs present in the granum is called a thylakoid. Each granum is connected to each other by stroma lamellae. Fig. 9. Structure of chloroplast Chromoplasts are plastids responsible for pigment synthesis and storage. They give yellow, orange, red colors to fruits and flowers. Leucoplast are colorless plastids and acts as storage organelles. 7 ","Leucoplast are colorless plastids that are divided into- amyloplast that store starch, Elaioplast stores lipids in fats, proteinoplast stores proteins. Nucleus Nucleus is a double membrane structure found in eukaryotes. Eukaryotes have single nucleus except the red blood cells which do not contain nucleus. Nucleus contain genetic material known as DNA packed in the form of chromosomes with proteins known as histones. There are two types of chromosomes found- Euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is a less compact structure that can be transcribed (formation of messenger RNA from DNA). Heterochromatin is a compact structure that cannot be transcribed. The fragment of DNA that codes for a protein is known as gene. Nuclear membrane is impermeable to large molecules, so nuclear pores are present that regulates the movement of solutes in and out of the nucleus. Nucleolus is the largest structure found inside the nucleus of eukaryotes. It is involved in the assembly of the ribosomes. Fig. 10. Structure of nucleus Peroxisomes Peroxisomes are found in all prokaryotic cell. The major function of peroxisomes is to breakdown of fatty acids.

They possess a core made up of numerous microtubules running parallel to the long axis. This core is called as axoneme. It shows a 9+2 arrangement, where 9 is the number of pairs of radially arranged microtubule doublets and 2 is the central pair of microtubules. 9 ","Centrosomes and centrioles: A pair of cylindrical structures called as centrioles compose the centrosome. Centrioles are perpendicular to each other. A centriole is made up of nine peripheral triplet fibrils of tubulin protein. The proteinaceous center of the centriole is called as hub. It is connected by spokes to the peripheral fibrils. The centrioles form the base of flagella and also form the spindle during cell division. Structure of a prokaryotic cell: Represented by bacteria, mycoplasma, cyanobacteria, PPLOs the prokaryotes are much smaller and more rapidly dividing than eukaryotes. They vary in shape but their basic organization remains similar. Except mycoplasmas, a cell wall surrounds the cell. They do not have a well-defined nucleus. Additionally they may also have extra-nuclear circular DNA called as plasmids in case of bacteria. They lack all cell organelles except for ribosomes. Bacterial cells, if motile, possess one or more flagella. A flagellum has three parts: filament, hook and basal body. Pili and fimbriae help the bacteria to attach to substrate or host. A pilus can also help in conjugation. 10 ","Biomolecules Biomolecules Biomolecule is an organic molecule that is produced by living organism. They act as building block of life and perform important functions in living organisms. They are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous and Sulphur. The four common biomolecules are- proteins, nucleic acid, carbohydrates, and lipids. Analysis of chemical composition For analysis of chemical composition of organic compound, living tissues are treated with trichloroacetic acid and grind it to form slurry. For inorganic chemical composition, sample of tissue should be burnt to obtain ash. Proteins Any of a class of nitrogenous organic compounds which have large molecules composed of one or more long chains of amino acids and are an essential part of all living organisms. The building blocks of proteins are known as amino acids. There are 22 naturally occurring amino acids found in nature. Amino acids are made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. So, single amino acid is made up of amino group, carboxyl group, hydrogen atom and distinctive side chain, all bonded to alpha-carbon. Fig.1. structure of amino acid When amino acids are dissolved in water, it exists in solution as the dipolar ion or zwitterion . They can either act as proton donor or proton acceptor. 1 ","Fig. 2. Zwitterion All amino acids are optically active, that is, they can rotate the plane of polarized light. Optically active molecules contain chiral carbon except glycine. A tetrahedral carbon atom with four different constituents is said to be chiral. Peptide is a compound consisting of two or more amino acids. When two amino acids are linked together via peptide bond, they are said to form a dipeptide . Three amino acids join to form tripeptide etc. Peptide chains of 12 to 20 amino acids form oligopeptide . When many amino acids are joined, they form polypeptide . The first amino acid is known as N terminal or amino terminal and last amino acid is said to be C terminal or carboxyl terminal. Fig. 3. Formation of peptide bond Protein structure 2 ","Proteins have four levels of protein organization. They are as follows- Primary structure of the protein is its sequence of amino acids. Amino acids are joined by a peptide bond. Secondary structures are higher level of protein organization which includes- alpha helix and beta sheets. Both of them are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between carbonyl and N-H groups in a polypeptide backbone. Alpha helix is a rigid, rod like structure that forms when a polypeptide chain twists into a helical conformation. Beta pleated sheets are formed when two or more polypeptide chain segment line up side by side. Each individual segment is known as beta strand. Tertiary structures are the three-dimensional conformations that a protein assumes as a result of the interactions among the side chains in their primary structure. They are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, van der waals forces and covalent bonds. Fig. 4. Levels of protein organization Quaternary structures are composed of two or more polypeptide chains. Polypeptides are held together via hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds etc. For example, hemoglobin. Fibrous and globular proteins Fibrous are long, rod shaped molecules which are insoluble in water. They are generally protective and structural in nature. Globular proteins are compact spherical molecules that are usually water soluble. Nucleic acids Nucleic acid was first discovered by Friedrich Miescher from the nuclei of pus cells. There two types of nucleic acids- deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) and ribonucleic acids (RNA) . The monomeric unit of nucleic acid is known as nucleotides. Nucleotide is made up of three components- a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar and phosphoric acid. 3 ","Fig. 5. Structure of nucleotide Nitrogenous bases are heterocyclic, aromatic molecules. There are basically two types of nucleic acids - purines and pyrimidines . Purines are of two types- adenine and guanine whereas pyrimidines can be thymine, cytosine, or uracil. Fig. 6. Structure of purines and pyrimidines The 5- carbon sugar found in DNA is deoxyribose and for RNA is ribose . Nucleotide without phosphate is known as nucleoside. 4 ","Structure of double stranded DNA DNA are of different types such as- B DNA • Two long polynucleotide strands are coiled around the axis. • Strands are antiparallel to each other. • Guanine base pairs with cytosine and adenine base pairs with thymine. • Guanine forms 3 hydrogen bonds with cytosine whereas adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine. Z DNA • They are thinner than B DNA. • They have alternating purine and pyrimidine bases. • They are stabilized by high salt concentration. Denaturation of DNA When DNA is subjected to varying pH, temperature etc, two DNA strands separate out. That is the DNA is said to be denatured. If the denaturant such as temperature, pH is removed, the DNA regains its original or native structure. This is known as renaturation or annealing. Fig. 7. Process of denaturation RNA RNA known as ribonucleic acid. It usually exists as single strand. RNA exists in cells in various forms as explained below- 5 ","Messenger RNA carries genetic information from DNA in the form of codons (three nucleotides forms a codon), which codes for amino acids or protein. Transfer RNA plays an important role during protein synthesis. They act as an interface between nucleic acid language and protein language. They are fund in the cytosol of the living cell. Ribosomal RNA is a component of ribosomes. They have important roles during protein synthesis in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Carbohydrates They are defined as the polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones. They consist of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. The simplest carbohydrates are known as monosaccharides, such as glucose. Two monosaccharides joined to form disaccharides. Polymers of 2 to 10 units of monosaccharides is known as oligosaccharides . When hundreds to thousands of monosaccharides are joined, they are known as polysaccharides. Monosaccharides with aldehyde group is known as aldoses. And monosaccharides with ketone group is known as ketoses. Trioses are the simplest monosaccharides. Some common saccharides Starch is the storage form of energy is plants. It is a branched polysaccharide made up of glucose units. It is mixture of two different polymers amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is the unbranched polymer of glucose units whereas amylopectin is the branched polymer of glucose units. Fig. 8. Structure of starch Glycogen is the storage form of energy in animals. It is stored in muscle and liver. It is also a highly-branched polymer made up of amylose and amylopectin. 6 ","Fig. 9. Structure of glycogen Cellulose is an unbranched polymer of glucose units. It is a structural polysaccharide of plant cells. It is the most abundant organic molecule in the biosphere. It is found in plant cells and provide strength and rigidity to the cell. Fig. 10. Structure of cellulose Chitin is a linear polysaccharide composed of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues. It is found in the exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans. Reducing and non-reducing sugar Sugars capable of reducing ferric or cupric ion are called reducing sugar. All monosaccharides are reducing sugars. Non-reducing sugars are not capable of reducing ferric or cupric ion. For example, sucrose is a non-reducing sugar. Lipids They are insoluble or poorly insoluble in water. They are soluble in non-polar solvents such as ether, chloroform or benzene. Biological functions of lipids 7 ","• They serve as storage form of energy. • They are major component of membranes. • They are protective in function such as in bacteria, plants, insects, and vertebrates. Fatty acids They are the simplest form of lipids. They are composed of long chains of hydrocarbons with one carboxyl group. The alkyl chain may be saturated or unsaturated. Unsaturated fatty acids may contain one or more double bonds. They have both polar and non-polar ends. Mammals are unable to synthesize some fatty acids such as linoleate. Such fatty acids must be obtained from the diet, they are known as essential fatty acids. Some fatty acids can be synthesized endogenously, they are known as non-essential fatty acids. Fig. 11. Structure of fatty acids Triacylglycerol also known as triglycerides are esters of fatty acids and glycerol. They are non-polar, hydrophobic in nature. Enzymes Almost all enzymes are proteins. Similar to protein, enzymes as primary, secondary and tertiary structure. Enzyme has an active site to which the substrate molecule can come and bind. The following are the properties of the enzymes- • All enzymes are proteins, but all proteins are not enzymes. • Enzymes are specific for their substrate. • Enzymes acts as catalysts. • They are not used up during the reaction. • They are of six major types: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, ligases and isomerases. • Some enzymes require a co-factor and/or a co-enzyme to function. 8 ","• Co-factor: Non-protein constituents that are bound to the enzyme and make the enzyme catalytically active. • Co-enzyme: Organic compounds that bind to the enzyme transiently during the course of the reaction. • Prosthetic groups: Organic substances that are bound very tightly to the enzyme. Factors affecting the enzyme activity Temperature, pH and substrate concentration affects the enzyme activity. High or low temperature inactivates the enzyme activity. Deprotonation or protonation alters the enzyme activity. Enzyme can also be inactivated by molecules known as inhibitors. The most common type of inhibitors are competitive inhibitors. These inhibitors compete with substrate for binding to the enzyme active site. For example, inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by Malonate. 9 ","10 ","Cell Cycle and Cell Division Cell cycle Cell cycle is defined as the series of changes that occur in a cell which leads to division of cells into two daughter cells. Cell cycle is divided into two phases- interphase and mitosis. The average duration of cell cycle in human cells is 24 hours. Of this, mitosis lasts for only 1 hour. Therefore, the majority of cell cycle is spent in interphase. Fig. 1. Cell cycle Interphase It is a phase in which different changes occurs to prepare the cell for cell division. It is further divided into following phases- G1 phase is also known as first gap phase. During this phase, biosynthetic activities occur at a very fast rate. Cell synthesizes more proteins, increase the number of mitochondria and ribosomes. Cell also prepares itself for DNA replication. S phase is the phase where DNA is replicated. At the end of DNA replication, each chromosome is with two sister chromatids. Thus, the amount of DNA gets doubled during this phase, but the ploidy remains same. G2 phase is the phase where the cell prepare itself for mitosis. It also involves protein synthesis and further growth of the cell. Mitosis 1 ","Called as equational division as the number of chromosomes in the daughter cell and the parent cell remains the same. It begins with nuclear division. This is known as karyokinesis. Chromosomes get distributed equally during mitosis. It takes place only in somatic cells. It is divided into following phases- Prophase During this phase chromatin condenses to form chromosomes. There are two identical copies of each chromosome which are attached to centromere. During the end of the prophase, nucleolus dissolves. Nuclear membrane also disintegrates at the end. The centrosome moves to the opposite poles. Spindle fibers starts to appear. Fig. 2. Prophase of mitosis Metaphase During this phase, chromosomes aligned themselves on the equatorial plate. The analysis of the metaphase chromosome is used in cytogenetics and cancer studies. 2 ","Fig. 3. Metaphase of mitosis Anaphase It is the shortest stage of the cell cycle. During this phase, the replicated chromosomes move apart and daughter chromatids move to the opposite poles. Chromosomes are maximally condensed during late anaphase. The chromosomes appear Y- shaped as they move to the opposite poles. Fig. 4. Anaphase of mitosis Telophase 3 ","This is where two daughter nuclei are formed. Nucleolus and nuclear membrane re-appear. The late telophase is marked by cytokinesis. This is last phase of mitosis. Finally the chromosomes reach the poles. Fig. 5. Telophase of mitosis Cytokinesis The division of cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane to form two cells is known as cytokinesis. It divides the cell into two daughter cells which are identical to the parent cell. 4 ","Fig. 6. Cytokinesis Importance of mitosis • Produce genetically identical daughter cells. • Growth of the body occurs via mitosis. • Cell repair and replacement also occurs via mitosis. • Maintenance of nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. Cell cycle exit Some cells divide at a fast rate whereas some divides slowly and some even do not divide once they are formed. Those cells which do not divide once formed, enter into a phase known as G O phase. For example, neuronal cells once formed will not divide. Meiosis Also known as reductional division because it reduces the number of chromosomes to half the parent cell. It is of two types meiosis I and meiosis II. Gametes such as sperm or egg are formed by meiosis. Meiosis I It is divided into following phases- Prophase I It is the longest phase of meiosis I. During this phase, homologous chromosomes pairs and DNA segments are exchanged (known as recombination). It is further divided into following- Leptotene • It is the first stage of meiosis. • Each individual chromosome exists with two sister chromatids. • Elements of synaptonemal complex assemble. • Condensation and coiling of chromosomes occur. Zygotene • Chromosomes align as homologous pair of chromosomes. • Synapsis of homologous chromosomes occur. • The paired chromosomes are known as bivalent or tetrad. 5 ","Fig. 7. Different stages of prophase I of meiosis I Pachytene • During this stage, crossing over and homologous recombination occurs. • Chiasmata are formed where homologous chromosomes exchange there segments. Diplotene • Homologous chromosomes start to separate. • Synaptonemal complex disassemble. • Chromosomes remain bound at the chiasmata. Diakinesis • Chromosomes condenses further, so that four parts of the tetrads are visible. • The nucleoli disappear, nuclear membrane disintegrates. • Mitotic spindle starts to form. Metaphase I 6 ","Homologous chromosomes are aligned on the metaphasic plate. The replicated chromosomes are joined together via protein known as cohesin. Fig. 8. Metaphase I Anaphase I As the kinetochore microtubules shorten, homologous chromosomes are pulled to the opposite poles. The cohesin (protein complex) degrades from the chromosome arms while remaining safe surrounding the centromere. Thus the sister chromatids remain together while homologs segregate. Fig. 9. Metaphase I Telophase I Each daughter cell now has half the number of chromosomes as compared to parent cell. The microtubules forming the spindle begin to disappear. The chromosomes forms chromatin once again. Sister chromatids remain attached. 7 ","Fig. 10. Telophase I Meiosis II Meiosis II is the second meiotic division. It is similar to mitosis, but the genetic results are different. It results in the formation of four haploid cells from the two haploid cells produced in meiosis I. The four main steps of Meiosis II are as follows- Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, and Telophase II. In prophase II nucleoli and nuclear membrane disappears. Shortening and thickening of the chromatids also occur during this phase. Centrosomes move to the poles and spindle fibers are formed for the second meiotic division. 8 ","Fig. 11. Different stages of meiosis II In metaphase II , the centromeres are present with two kinetochores that are attached to spindle fibers from the centrosomes at opposite poles. The metaphasic plate is rotated by 90 degrees when compared to meiosis I, perpendicular to the previous plate. Anaphase II is accompanied by sister chromatid segregation. The remaining cohesin is degraded to allow sister chromatid segregation. Telophase II , which is like telophase I, de-condensation of chromosomes occurs. Nuclear envelopes reorganize and cleavage or cell plate formation starts to produce four daughter cells, each with a haploid set of chromosomes. Significance of Meiosis: • Maintenance of chromosome number generation after generation in case of sexual reproduction. • Increases variation in population.

It includes transport of water, minerals as well as solutes. Means of transport There are basically three means of transport in plants- • Diffusion is the most common means of transport in plants. It is defined as the movement of molecules from the region of high concentration to the region of low concentration without the need of the energy. So, diffusion is a passive process. Concentration gradient, temperature, and pressure affect the rate of diffusion. • Facilitated diffusion is the transport process brought about by certain proteins known as permeases . It is also a passive process. When all the protein available for transport is saturated, transport reaches maximum. It is a specific process that allows only certain molecules to pass. Porins and aquaporins are protein that helps in facilitated diffusion. Porins are pores present in cell organelles such as mitochondria, plastids, and even in some bacterial cells. Aquaporins are water channels that transport water molecules. Fig.1. Passive transport Facilitated diffusion can occur by the following process- • Symport is the transport of more than one molecule in the same direction. • Antiport is the transport of molecules in opposite direction. • Uniport is the transport of single molecules in any direction. 1 ","Fig.2. Types of facilitated transport • Active transport in plants requires expenditure of energy for the transport of molecules. It can transport solutes from the region of low concentration to the region of high concentration and vice versa. Membrane proteins are involved in active transport. It is a specific mode of transport of solutes. Fig.3. Active transport Plant water relations Water is essential for the growth of the plants. But excess or less water is harmful for the plants. Terrestrial plants lose some amount of water from the aerial parts of the plants in the form of water vapor is known as transpiration . Water potential The measure of potential energy of water is known as water potential . Solute potential and pressure potential determines the water potential of the cell. Pure water has the highest water potential. Water always moves from higher water potential to lower water potential. Water potential is denoted by a symbol psi or Ψ . The unit used to express water potential is Pascals. 2 ","Fig.4. Water potential If some solute is added to pure water, the water potential drops to negative. This is known as solute potential . It is represented by symbol Ψ s . If pressure is greater than the atmospheric pressure in case of pure water, water potential increases. From fig.4 it is clear that water moves from a region of high water potential to a region of low water potential or from dilute solution to concentrated solution. When water enters the plant cell, pressure develops inside the cell against the cell wall making its more turgid. This raises the pressure potential. So, the relationship between water potential, solute potential and pressure potential are as follows- Fig.5. Relation between different potentials Osmosis It is defined as the process of movement of water molecules across the semi-permeable membrane. The movement of water depends on concentration gradient and pressure gradient. 3 ","Fig.6. Osmosis` The movement of water molecules occurs till the equilibrium reaches between the two solutions. The pressure applied to prevent the net movement of solute molecules across the membrane is known as osmotic pressure. Osmosis is essential for the movement of molecules such as ions, proteins, and polysaccharides across the membranes. Plasmolysis The behavior of the plant cells chances with respect to the external medium. If the osmotic potential of the plant cell is same as that of external medium, the solution is considered isotonic solution . If the osmotic potential is more outside the cell with respect to inside the cell, the solution is said to be hypertonic solution . If solute potential is more inside the cell as compared to outside the cell, the solution is said to be hypotonic solution . Fig.7. Types of osmotic solution Hypertonic solution results in movement of water molecules outside the cell. The cell is now known as flaccid . When a cell is kept in hypotonic solution, the water moves inside the cell. The cell is said to be turgid . The process of shrinkage of protoplasm away from the cell wall when a plant cell is kept in hypertonic solution is 4 ","plasmolysis. As a result of being placed in a hypertonic solution water moves out of the cell. This is known as plasmolysis . Fig.8. Plasmolysis Imbibition The absorption of water by solids, causing them to become enlarge in size is known as imbibition. The swelling of raisins when kept in water is the most common example of imbibition. This is considered like diffusion as water is moving from high concentration to low concentration, that is, along the concentration gradient. Long distance transport of water Long distance transport is the faster mode of transport of water. Generally, water, food and minerals move by bulk flow or mass flow. Mass flow occurs between the two solutions of different pressure. The movement of substances though the vascular tissues of the plants, is known as translocation. Vascular tissues include xylem and phloem. Xylem helps in movement of water molecules from roots to different parts of the plant. Phloem helps in the movement of food from the leaves to different parts of the plants. Different pathways of water absorption Plants absorb water from the roots. Roots contain root hairs that are mainly involved in absorption of water and minerals from the soil. There are two pathways for the movement of water from the roots to different parts of the plant. These pathways are as follows- • Apoplast pathway involves the movement of water in the non-living parts of the plants such as intercellular spaces and cell wall. The endodermis interrupts this pathway. Endodermis is covered by casparian strips that prevents the movement of water. It does not involve the movement of water via cell membrane. 5 ","Fig.9. Pathways of water movement • Symplast pathway is the movement of water via protoplasts with the help of the cell to cell connections known as plasmodesmata. It helps in the direct movement from cytoplasm to cytoplasm. This process occurs slowly as compared to apoplastic pathway of water movement. Some plants such as Pinus have different structures for the absorption of water, known as Mycorrhiza. Mycorrhiza are the fungal association between the fungus and the roots of the higher plants. It is a symbiotic relation between the fungus and the roots of the plants. The fungal hyphae help in absorption of mineral ions and water from the soil whereas the roots provide sugars and N-containing compounds to the roots of the plants. Water movement up the plant Root pressure and transpiration pull are the two forces that helps in water movement up the plants. • Root pressure arises when ions present in the soil are actively transported into the vascular tissues of the roots, which results in positive pressure inside the roots. This pressure is known as the root pressure which drives upward movement of water. Root pressure is observed when a stem is cut horizontally from the base. A liquid will ooze out from the cut stem. The effect of root pressure can also be observed during night time. When rate of evaporation is low, excess water in the form of water droplets is observed near the tips of the leaves. This is known as guttation . • Transpiration pull is the driving force for upward movement of water. Cohesion-tension theory was given by Dixon and Jolly, to explain the upward movement of water in the plants. Cohesion is the attraction between the water molecules. Adhesion is the attraction between the water molecules and other polar 6 ","molecules. Another property that promotes transpiration pull is surface tension. Surface tension is the attraction between the water molecules in liquid phase. When transpiration occurs, water is lost which creates a negative pressure in the xylem vessels. This is known as transpiration pull. Transpiration Transpiration is the loss of water in the form of water vapor from leaves through stomata. Stomata are small openings present in the leaves which opens in the day and close during the night time. Factors affecting the transpiration • High temperature raises the rate of transpiration. • More surface area raises the rate of evaporation. • High humidity decreases the rate of evaporation. • Wind speed also raises the rate of evaporation. Uptake and transport of mineral nutrients Minerals are absorbed from the plants passively as well as actively. Most of the transport occurs actively as ions are charged and cannot cross the membrane without the expenditure of the energy. The energy is provided in the form of ATP. The end product of photosynthesis, that is, sucrose is transported from the source (where synthesis occurs such as leaves) to sink (organs that store food). The transport of food or sucrose is bidirectional as compared to transport of water, which is, unidirectional. The pressure flow hypothesis or mass flow hypothesis or Munch hypothesis was proposed for translocation of sugars from source to sink. This occurs via phloem. Phloem is made up of sieve tubes, companion cells and phloem parenchyma. Sieve tubes and companion cells are actively involved in movement of food from source to sink. The movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the source, where sugars are loaded into a sieve tube. The loading in sieve tubes creates a hypertonic environment due to which water enters the phloem. The high osmotic pressure at source causes the food/sucrose to move towards the sink (with low osmotic pressure). So, it can be concluded that osmotic pressure drives the translocation of food from the source to the sink. 7 ","Fig.10.
